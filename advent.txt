The Service for 3rd Order of Holy Communion
In Advent

The Greeting and Prayers

   The Lord be with you
      And Also with you

   Our Lord Jesus Christ said:
   You shall love the Lord your God
   with all your heart, and with all your soul,
   and with all your mind,
   and with all your strength.

   This is the great and first commandment.
   And a second is like it:
   You shall love your neighbour as yourself.

   On these two commandments
   hang all the law and the prophets.
Matthew 22.37-40, Mark 12.30-31

   Let us pray.
      Almighty God,
      to Whom all hearts are open,
      all desires known,
      and from Whom no secrets are hidden:
      cleanse the thoughts of our hearts
      by the inspiration of Your Holy Spirit,
      that we may perfectly love You,
      and worthily magnify Your holy Name,
      through Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Seasonal Collect for Advent
or the Collect for the week is read

   Almighty God,
      give us grace
      that we may cast away the works of darkness
      and put on the armour of light,
      now in the time of this mortal life
      in which Your Son Jesus Christ came among us
      in great humility,
      that on the last day,
      when He shall come again in His glorious majesty
      to judge the living and the dead,
      we may rise to the life immortal;
      through Him Who lives and reigns with You
      and the Holy Spirit,
      one God, now and for ever. Amen.


The readings appropriate to the day are read.

A homily may be given

The Prayers

Prayers may be made for particular needs, 
finishing with the Lord's Prayer.


   Accept our prayers
   through Jesus Christ our Lord,
   Who taught us to pray,

      Our Father in heaven,
      hallowed be Your Name,
      Your kingdom come,
      Your will be done,
      on earth as in heaven.
      Give us today our daily bread.
      Forgive us our sins
      as we forgive those who sin against us.
      Save us from the time of trial
      and deliver us from evil.
      For the kingdom, the power, and the glory
      are Yours now and for ever. Amen.

Preparation for The Lord's Supper

   The Lord comes,
   bringing to light things hidden in darkness,
   and disclosing the purposes of the heart.


   Let us open our hearts and prepare for His coming,
   confessing our sins in penitence and faith.


      Heavenly Father,
      You have loved us with an everlasting love,
      but we have broken Your holy laws
      and have left undone
      what we ought to have done.
      We are sorry for our sins
      and turn away from them.
      For the sake of Your Son Who died for us,
      forgive us, cleanse us and change us.
      By Your Holy Spirit,
      enable us to live for You;
      through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The priest declares God's forgiveness.
   God is slow to anger and full of compassion,
   forgiving all who humbly repent
   and trust in His Son as Saviour and Lord.
   God therefore forgives you in Christ Jesus,
   in Whom there is no condemnation.  Amen.

One or more of the following passages
may also be read

   as an assurance of God's forgiveness.
   God so loved the world
   that He gave His only Son,
   so that everyone who believes in Him
   may not perish but may have eternal life.
John 3.16

   As far as the east is from the west,
   so far has God removed our sins from us.
Psalm 103.12

   Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself
   bore our sins in His body on the cross,
   so that we might die to sin
   and live for righteousness;
   by His wounds you have been healed.
1 Peter 2.24


   The peace of the Lord be always with you.
      And also with you.


The Great Thanksgiving

   Lift up your hearts.
      We lift them to the Lord.

   Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
      It is right to give our thanks and praise.


      You are worthy, our Lord and God,
      to receive glory and honour and power,
      for You created all things,
      making us in Your own image.
      We praise You for Your Son,
      our Saviour Jesus Christ,
      Who by His death on the cross
      and rising to new life
      offered the one true sacrifice for sin
      and obtained an eternal deliverance for His people.

      In Him the day of our deliverance has dawned.
      We rejoice that through Him, You make all things new
      and we look for His coming in power and majesty
      to judge the world.
      Therefore, we lift our voices to praise You, saying,
      Holy, holy, holy Lord,
      God of power and might,
      heaven and earth are full of Your glory.
      Hosanna in the highest.


   And now, gracious God,
   we thank You for these gifts of bread and wine,
   and pray that we who receive them,
   in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
   according to our Saviour's word,
   in remembrance of His suffering and death,
   may share His body and blood.


   On the night before He died, Jesus took bread,
   and when He had given You thanks He broke it,
   and gave it to His disciples, saying,
   Take and eat.
   This is My body which is given for you.
   Do this in remembrance of Me.

   After supper, He took the cup,
   and again giving You thanks
   He gave it to His disciples, saying,
   Drink from this, all of you.
   This is My blood of the new covenant
   which is shed for you and for many
   for the forgiveness of sins.
   Do this, as often as you drink it,
   in remembrance of Me.

   We eat this bread and drink this cup
      to proclaim the death of the Lord.
   We do this until He returns.
      Come, Lord Jesus!

   Father,
   as we recall His saving death
   and glorious resurrection,
   may we who share these gifts
   be renewed by Your Holy Spirit
   and united in the body of Your Son.

   Bring us with all Your people
   into the joy of Your eternal kingdom,
   there to feast at Your table and
   join in Your eternal praise:

   Worthy is the Lamb, Who was slain,
   to receive praise and honour
   and glory and power
   for ever and ever. Amen.


The minister gives an invitation to communion


After the Communion

   God for Whom we wait,
   we thank You, that You have fed us
   with the bread of life
   and the cup of salvation.
   As we joyfully await Your Son,
   keep us ever watchful
   that we may be ready to stand before Him
   on the day of His coming.

      Father, we offer ourselves to You
      as a living sacrifice
      through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      Send us out in the power of Your Spirit
      to live and work to Your praise and glory.


The Blessing

   Christ the Sun of Righteousness
   shine upon you,
   and make you ready to meet Him
   when He comes in glory.
   and the blessing of God Almighty,
   The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit
   be among you and remain with you always.
   Amen.
