B=bless the Lord who forgives all our sins,

The Priest says:

Hear the commandments which God gave to Israel:

1. I am the Lord your God 

who brought you out of the land of slavery 

you shall have no other gods but me.


2. You shall not make for yourself a graven image, 

or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, 

or that is on the earth beneath, 

or that is in the water under the earth; 

you shall not bow down to them or serve them.


3. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.


4. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.  

Six days shall you labour and do all you have to do, 

but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God.


5. Honour your father and your mother.

6. You shall do no murder.

7. You shall not commit adultery.

8. You shall not steal.

9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour.

10. You shall not covet anything that is your neighbour's.

Lord, have mercy upon us:  

    and write your law in our hearts by your Holy Spirit.


Let us pray.

Almighty God,

to Whom all hearts are open,

all desires known,

and from Whom no secrets are hidden:

cleanse the thoughts of our hearts

by the inspiration of Your Holy Spirit,

that we may perfectly love You,

and worthily magnify Your holy Name,

through Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Collect for Lent

Almighty and everlasting God,

You hate nothing that You have made,

and You forgive the sins of all who are penitent:

create and make in us new and contrite hearts,

that we, worthily lamenting our sins,

and acknowledging our wretchedness,

may obtain of You, the God of all mercy,

perfect remission and forgiveness;

through Jesus Christ our Lord,

Who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit,

one God, now and for ever.   Amen.

Readings appropriate to the day may be read.

The Prayers

Prayers may be made for particular needs, finishing with the Lord?s Prayer.


Accept our prayers through Jesus Christ our Lord, 

Who taught us to pray, 


Our Father in heaven,

hallowed be Your Name,

Your kingdom come,

Your will be done,

on earth as in heaven. 

Give us today our daily bread. 

Forgive us our sins

as we forgive those who sin against us. 

Save us from the time of trial

and deliver us from evil.

For the kingdom, the power, and the glory 

are Yours now and for ever. Amen.

Preparation for The Lord's Supper


Seek the Lord while He may be found, 

call upon Him while He is near; 

let the wicked forsake their way, 

and the unrighteous their thoughts; 

let them return to the Lord, 

that He may have mercy on them, 

and to our God, 

for He will abundantly pardon. 

For My thoughts are not your thoughts, 

nor are your ways My ways, says the Lord.	

Isaiah 55.6-8


Compassion and forgiveness belong to the Lord our God, 

though we have rebelled and wandered far off.

Let us ask for mercy, 

confessing our sins in penitence and faith,

saying together,

Heavenly Father,

You have loved us with an everlasting love,

but we have broken Your holy laws

and have left undone what we ought to have done.

We are sorry for our sins and turn away from them. 

For the sake of Your Son Who died for us,

forgive us, cleanse us and change us.

By Your Holy Spirit, enable us to live for You;

through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.


The priest declares God?s forgiveness

God is slow to anger and full of compassion,

forgiving all who humbly repent

and trust in His Son as Saviour and Lord.

God therefore forgives you in Christ Jesus,

in Whom there is no condemnation	Amen.


Greeting of peace

Christ has reconciled us to God in one body by the cross.

   We meet in His Name and share His peace.

The Peace of the Lord be always with you

   And also with you

The Great Thanksgiving for Lent


Lift up your hearts.

   We lift them to the Lord. 

Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.

   It is right to give our thanks and praise.

You are worthy, our Lord and God,

to receive glory and honour and power,

for You created all things,

making us in Your own image. 

We give You thanks and praise 

for Your Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ,

Who by the power of your Spirit 

was born of Mary and lived as one of us.


He was tempted in every way as we are,

yet He did not sin.

By His death on the cross

and rising to new life,

He offered the one true sacrifice for sin

and obtained an eternal deliverance for His people.

By His grace we are able to triumph over every evil,

and to walk in the way of His love.

Therefore, we lift our voices to praise You, saying,

  Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,

  heaven and earth are full of Your glory.

  Hosanna in the highest.


And now, gracious God, 

we thank You for these gifts of bread and wine, 

and pray that we who receive them, 

in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, 

according to our Saviour's word, 

in remembrance of His suffering and death, 

may share His body and blood.

On the night before He died, Jesus took bread, 

and when He had given You thanks He broke it, 

and gave it to His disciples, saying, Take and eat. 

This is my body which is given for you. 

Do this in remembrance of Me.'

After supper, He took the cup,

and again giving You thanks

He gave it to His disciples, saying,

'Drink from this, all of you.

This is My blood of the new covenant

which is shed for you and for many

for the forgiveness of sins.

Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.'

We eat this bread and drink this cup

   to proclaim the death of the Lord. 

We do this until He returns.

   Come, Lord Jesus!


Father, as we recall His saving death and glorious resurrection,

may we who share these gifts

be renewed by Your Holy Spirit

and united in the body of Your Son. 

Bring us with all Your people

into the joy of Your eternal kingdom,

there to feast at Your table and

join in Your eternal praise:


  Worthy is the Lamb, 

  Who was slain, 

  to receive praise and honour and glory and power 

  for ever and ever. Amen.


Come let us take this holy sacrament 

of the body and blood of Christ

in remembrance that He died for us,

and feed on Him in our hearts 

by faith with thanksgiving.

Prayer after Communion

God of mercy,

may we who have shared in this holy meal

know Your forgiveness in our lives,

bring Your reconciliation to others,

and be a sign of Your wholeness in this broken world.


Father,

  we offer ourselves to You

  as a living sacrifice

  through Jesus Christ our Lord.

  Send us out 

  in the power of Your Spirit

  to live and work 

  to Your praise and glory.



The Blessings

The priest gives the Blessing

Christ our Saviour draw you to Himself,

that you may find in Him crucified

a sure ground for faith,

a firm support for hope,

and the assurance of sin forgiven

and the blessing of God almighty

the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit

be with us all evermore, Amen.


A deacon, or lay reader may give the dismissal

Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

  In the Name of Christ, Amen.
