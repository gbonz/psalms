      your kingdom come,

      your will be done,

      on earth as in heaven.

      give us today our daily bread.

      forgive us our sins

preparation for the lord's supper

   seek the lord while he may be found,

   call upon him while he is near;

   let the wicked forsake their way,

   and the unrighteous their thoughts;

   let them return to the lord,

   that he may have mercy on them,

   and to our god,

   for he will abundantly pardon.

   for my thoughts are not your thoughts,

   nor are your ways my ways, says the lord.

isaiah 55.6-8

   compassion and forgiveness belong to the lord our god,

   though we have rebelled and wandered far off.

   let us ask for mercy,

   confessing our sins in penitence and faith,

   saying together,

      heavenly father,

      you have loved us with an everlasting love,

      but we have broken your holy laws

      and have left undone what we ought to have done.

      we are sorry for our sins and turn away from them.

      for the sake of your son who died for us,

      forgive us, cleanse us and change us.

      by your holy spirit, enable us to live for you;

      through jesus christ our lord. amen.


the priest declares god's forgiveness

   god is slow to anger and full of compassion,

   forgiving all who humbly repent

   and trust in his son as saviour and lord.

   god therefore forgives you in christ jesus,

   in whom there is no condemnation     amen.


greeting of peace

   christ has reconciled us to god in one body by the cross.

   we meet in his name and share his peace.

      and also with you

the great thanksgiving for lent


   lift up your hearts.

      we lift them to the lord.

   let us give thanks to the lord our god.

      it is right to give our thanks and praise.

   you are worthy, our lord and god,

   to receive glory and honour and power,

   for you created all things,

   making us in your own image.

   we give you thanks and praise

   for your son, our saviour jesus christ,

   who by the power of your spirit

   was born of mary and lived as one of us.

   he was tempted in every way as we are,

   yet he did not sin.

   by his death on the cross

   and rising to new life,

   he offered the one true sacrifice for sin

   and obtained an eternal deliverance for his people.

   by his grace we are able to triumph over every evil,

   and to walk in the way of his love.

   therefore, we lift our voices to praise you, saying,

      holy, holy, holy lord, god of power and might,

      heaven and earth are full of your glory.

      hosanna in the highest.


   and now, gracious god,

   we thank you for these gifts of bread and wine,

   and pray that we who receive them,

   in the fellowship of the holy spirit,

   according to our saviour's word,

   in remembrance of his suffering and death,


page 7

   may share his body and blood.

   on the night before he died, jesus took bread,

   and when he had given you thanks he broke it,

   and gave it to his disciples, saying, take and eat.

   this is my body which is given for you.

   do this in remembrance of me.'

   after supper, he took the cup,

   and again giving you thanks

   he gave it to his disciples, saying,

   'drink from this, all of you.

   this is my blood of the new covenant

   which is shed for you and for many

   for the forgiveness of sins.

   do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.'

   we eat this bread and drink this cup

      to proclaim the death of the lord.

   we do this until he returns.

      come, lord jesus!


   father, as we recall his saving death and glorious resurrection,

   may we who share these gifts

   be renewed by your holy spirit

   and united in the body of your son.

   bring us with all your people

   into the joy of your eternal kingdom,

   there to feast at your table and

   join in your eternal praise:


      worthy is the lamb,

      who was slain,

      to receive praise and honour and glory and power

      for ever and ever. amen.


page 8

   come let us take this holy sacrament

   of the body and blood of christ

   in remembrance that he died for us,

   and feed on him in our hearts

   by faith with thanksgiving.


prayer after communion

   god of mercy,

   may we who have shared in this holy meal

   know your forgiveness in our lives,

   bring your reconciliation to others,

   and be a sign of your wholeness in this broken world.


      father,

      we offer ourselves to you

      as a living sacrifice

      through jesus christ our lord.

      to your praise and glory.

   that you may find in him crucified

   a firm support for hope,

   and the assurance of sin forgiven

   and the blessing of god almighty

   the father, the son and the holy spirit

   be with us all evermore, amen.
