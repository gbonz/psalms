song of the three young men
verses 2, 11-20

2       then azariah stood and offered this prayer;
        in the midst of the fire he opened his mouth and said:

11      for your names sake do not give us up utterly,
        and do not break your covenant,

12      and do not withdraw your mercy from us,
        for the sake of abraham your beloved
        and for the sake of isaac your servant
        and israel your holy one,

13      to whom you have promised
        to make their descendants as many as the stars of heaven
        and as the sand on the shore of the sea.

14      for we, o lord, have become fewer than any nation,
        and this day are brought low in all the world because of our sins.

15      and at this time there is no prince, or prophet, or leader,
        no burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense,
        no place to make an offering before you or to find mercy.

16      yet with a contrite heart and a humble spirit may we be accepted,
        as though it were with burnt offerings of rams and bulls,
        and with tens of thousands of fat lambs;

17      such may our sacrifice be in your sight this day,
        and may we completely follow you,
        for there will be no shame for those who trust in you.

18      and now with all our heart we follow you,
        we fear you and seek your face.

19      do not put us to shame,
        but deal with us in your forbearance
        and in your abundant mercy.

20      deliver us in accordance with your marvelous works,
        and give glory to your name, o lord!
        let all who do harm to your servants be put to shame;
