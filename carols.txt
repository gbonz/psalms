1  Away In A Manger

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
the little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head;
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay,
the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The Cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
but little Lord Jesus no crying He makes.
I love You, Lord Jesus; look down from on high,
and stay by my side un-till morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask You to stay
close by me for ever, and love me I pray.
Bless all the dear children in Your tender care,
and fit us for heaven, to live with You there.

2  Child In The Manger

Child in the manger, infant of Mary;
outcast and stranger, Lord of all!
Child who inherits all our transgressions,
all our demerits on Him fall

Once the most holy Child of Salvation;
gentle and lowly lived below;
now, as our glorious, Mighty Redeemer,
see Him victorious o?er each foe.

Prophets foretold Him, infant of wonder:
angels behold Him on His throne;
worthy our Saviour of all their praises
happy forever are His own.

3  Hark, The Herald Angels Sing

Hark!  the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born king,
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled.
Joyful, all you nations, rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With the angelic host proclaim,
Christ is born in Bethlehem'
Hark!  the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King.

Christ, by highest heaven adored,
Christ the everlasting Lord,
Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of a virgin's womb!
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
Hail the incarnate Deity!
Pleased as man with man to dwell,
Jesus, our Immanuel.
Hark!  the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King.

Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die,
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.
Hail the heavenly Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Risen with healing in His wings.
Hark!  the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King.

Come, Desire of Nations, come
Fix in us Your humble home;
Rise, the woman's conquering Seed,
Bruise in us the serpent's head
Now display Your saving power,
Ruin'd nature now restore;
Now in mystic union join
Yours to ours and ours to Yours
Hark!  the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King.

Adam's likeness, Lord, efface
Stamp Your image in its place;
Second Adam from above,
Reinstate us in Your love
Let us You, though lost, regain,
You, the Life, the Inner Man:
Oh!, to all, Yourself impart,
Form'd in each believing heart.
Hark!  the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King.

4  The First Nowell

The first Nowell the angel did say
was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay,
in fields where they lay a keeping their sheep
on a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star
shining in the east, beyond them far,
and to the earth it gave great light
and so it continued, both day and night.
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same star
three wise men came from a country afar;
to seek for a king was their intent,
and to follow that star wherever it went.
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
born is the King of Israel.

The star drew nigh to the north west;
o'er Bethlehem it took it rest,
and there it did both stop and stay
right over the place where Jesus lay.
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three
full reverently upon their knee,
and offered their in His presence
their gold and myrrh and frankincense
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
born is the King of Israel.

Now let us all with one accord
sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
Who has made heaven and earth from nought,
and with His blood mankind has bought.
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
born is the King of Israel.

5  Joy To The World

Joy to the world!  The Lord is come;
let earth receive her king;
let every heart prepare Him room,
and heaven and nature sing,
and heaven and nature sing,
and heaven, and heaven and nature sing.

Joy to the world!  The Saviour reigns;
let all their songs employ;
while fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
repeat the sounding joy,
repeat the sounding joy,
repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sin and sorrow grow;
nor thorns infest the ground.
He comes to make His blessings flow
far as the curse is found,
far as the curse is found,
far as, far as the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
and makes the nations prove
the glories of His righteousness
and wonders of His love,
and wonders of His love,
and wonders, and wonders of His love.

6  Silent Night

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and Child.
Holy Infant, so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night,
Shepherds quake at the sight;
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavenly hosts sing Halleluiah!
Christ the Saviour is born,
Christ the Saviour is born!

Silent night, holy night,
Son of God, love?s pure light;
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.

Silent night, holy night
Wondrous star, lend thy light;
With the angels let us sing,
Halleluiah to our King;
Christ the Saviour is born,
Christ the Saviour is born!

7  O Little Town of Bethlehem

O little town of Bethlehem,
how still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by.
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
the everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary,
and gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars together,
proclaim the holy birth,
And praises sing to God the King,
and peace to men on earth!

How silently, how silently,
the wondrous Gift is giv?n;
So God imparts to human hearts
the blessings of His Heav?n.
No ear may hear His coming,
but in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
the dear Christ enters in.

O holy Child of Bethlehem,
descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in,
be born in us today.
We hear the Christmas angels
the great glad tidings tell;
O come to us, abide with us,
our Lord Emmanuel!

8  O Come All Ye faithful

O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
Come and behold Him, born the King of Angels.
O come let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

True God of true God, Light of Light eternal,
Lo, He abhors not the Virgin's womb;
Son of the Father, begotten not created:
O come let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

See how the shepherds summoned to His cradle,
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh with holy fear;
we too would thither bend our joyful footsteps:
O come let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation,
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above.
Glory to God,  glory in the highest:
O come let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

Yea, Lord we greet Thee, born this happy morning,
Jesus to Thee be glory given,
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing:
O come let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

9  Come Thou Long Expected Jesus

Come, Thou long expected Jesus
Born to set Thy people free;
From our fears and sins release us,
Let us find our rest in Thee.

Israel's Strength and Consolation,
Hope of all the earth Thou art;
Dear Desire of every nation,
Joy of every longing heart.

Born Thy people to deliver,
Born a child and yet a King,
Born to reign in us forever,
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.

By Thine own eternal Spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone;
By Thine all sufficient merit,
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.

10  What Child Is This?

What Child is this, Who, laid to rest,
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading:
Nails, spear, shall pierce Him through,
The Cross be borne, for me, for you:
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
Come peasant, king, to own Him,
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
Raise, raise the song on high,
The Virgin sings her lullaby:
Joy, joy for Christ is born,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

11 Infant Holy

Infant Holy,
infant lowly,
for His bed a cattle stall;
oxen lowing,
little knowing
Christ the babe is Lord of all;
swift are winging
angels singing,
nowells ringing,
tidings bringing,
Christ the babe is Lord of all.
Christ the babe is Lord of all.

Flocks were sleeping,
shepherds keeping
vigil till the morning new
saw the glory,
heard the story,
tidings of a gospel true;
thus rejoicing,
free from sorrow,
praises voicing
greet the morrow
Christ the babe was born for you.
Christ the babe was born for you.

12  Once in Royal David's City

Once in royal David?s city
stood a lowly cattle shed,
where a mother laid her baby
in a manger for His bed.
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little child.

He came down to earth from heaven
Who is God and Lord of all,
and His shelter was a stable,
and His cradle was a stall.
With the poor, and mean, and lowly
lived on earth our Saviour holy.

And through all His wondrous childhood
He would honour and obey,
love, and watch the lowly maiden
in whose gentle arms He lay.
Christian children all must be
mild obedient, good as He.

For He is our childhood's pattern:
Day by day like us He grew;
He was little, weak, and helpless;
tears and smile like us He knew;
and He feeleth for our sadness,
and He shareth in our gladness.

And our eyes at last shall see Him,
through His own redeeming love;
for that child so dear and gentle
is our Lord in heaven above;
and He leads His children on
to the place where He has gone.

Not in that poor lowly stable
with the oxen standing by,
we shall see Him: but in heaven
set at God's right hand on high,
when like stars His children crowned
all in white are gathered round

13  As With Gladness

As with gladness men of old
did the guiding star behold,
as with joy they hailed its light,
leading onward, beaming bright;
So, most gracious Lord, may we
evermore be led to Thee.

As with joyful steps they sped,
Saviour, to Thy lowly bed,
there to bend the knee before
Thee, whom heaven and earth adore;
So may we with willing feet
ever seek Thy mercy seat.

As they offered gifts most rare
At Thy cradle rude and bare.
So may we with holy joy,
pure, and free from sin's alloy,
all our costliest treasures bring,
Christ, to Thee our heavenly King.

Holy Jesus, every day
keep us in the narrow way;
and, when earthly things are past,
bring our ransomed souls at last
where they need no star to guide,
where no clouds Thy glory hide.

In the heavenly country bright
need they no created light;
Thou its light, its joy, its crown,
Thou its sun which goes not down;
There for ever may we sing
Hallelujahs to our King.

14  O Holy Night

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining;
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men from Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,
In all our trials born to be our Friend!
He knows our need?to our weakness is no stranger.
Behold your King; before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King; before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His Gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His Name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy Name!
Christ is the Lord! O praise His name forever!
His pow?r and glory evermore proclaim!
His pow?r and glory evermore proclaim!

15  While Shepherds Watched their Flocks By Night

While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around

Fear not! said he, for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind.
Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind.

To you in David's town, this day
Is born of David's line,
The Saviour, Who is Christ the Lord;
And this shall be the sign,

The heavenly babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapped in swaddling bands,
And in a manger laid!

Thus spake the seraph; and forthwith
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels praising God, who thus
Addressed their joyful song:

All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace;
Good-will hence forth from heaven to men
Begin and never cease!

He has opened the heavenly door,
and man is blessed for evermore;
Christ was born for this,

17  God Rest You Merry Gentlemen

God rest you merry, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay,
For Jesus Christ our Saviour
Was born on Christmas Day;
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.

O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy.

From God our heavenly Father
A blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same;
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name.

O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy.

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind,
And went to Bethl'em straightaway
This blessed Babe to find.

O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy.

But when to Bethlehem they came
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay;
His mother Mary kneeling
Unto the Lord did pray.

O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy.

Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
In this holy time of Christmas
God shows to us His grace.

O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy.

Angels, from the realms of glory,
wing your flight o'er all the earth;

now proclaim Messiah's birth:

Come and worship

Come and worship,

Shepherds in the fields abiding,
watching o'er your flocks by night
God with man is now residing;
yonder shines the infant Light:

Come and worship

Come and worship,
worship Christ the new-born King

Wise men, leave your contemplations,
brighter visions beam afar;
seek the Great desire of nations,
you have seen His natal star:

Come and worship
Christ the new-born King,
Come and worship,
worship Christ the new-born King

Saints, before the altar bending,
watching long in hope and fear,
suddenly the Lord descending,
in His temple shall appear:

Come and worship
Christ the new-born King,
Come and worship,
worship Christ the new-born King

19  It Came Upon The Midnight Clear

It came upon the Midnight clear,
that glorious song of old,
from angels bending near the earth
to touch their harps of gold:
Peace on the earth, good-will to all
from heaven's all gracious King.
The world in solemn stillness lay
to hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come
with peaceful wings unfurled;
and still their heavenly music floats
o?er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
they bend on hovering wing,
and ever o?er its babel sounds
the blessed angels sing.

Yet with the woes of sin and strife
the world has suffered long;
beneath the angel-strain have rolled
two thousand years of wrong;
and man at war with man hears not
the words of peace they bring:
O listen now, all you in strife,
and hear the angels sing.

O you beneath life's crushing load
whose forms are bending low,
who toil along the climbing way
with painful steps and slow:
Look now, for glad and golden hours
come swiftly on the wing:
O rest beside the weary road,
and hear the angels sing.

For lo, the days are hastening on,
by prophets seen of old,
when with the ever-circling years
shall come the time foretold,
when the new heaven and earth shall own
the Prince of Peace their King,
and the whole world send back the song
which now the angels sing.

20  We Three kings

We three Kings of Orient are,
Bearing gifts we traverse afar,
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder star.

O Star of wonder, Star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
West-ward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light.

Born a king on Bethlehem's plain,
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never,
Over us all to reign.

O Star of wonder, Star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
West-ward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light.

Frankincense to offer have I,
Incense owns a Deity nigh,
Pray?r and praising, all men raising,
Worship Him, God most High.

O Star of wonder, Star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
West-ward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light.

Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume
Breathes of life of gathering gloom;
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Seal?d in the stone cold tomb.

O Star of wonder, Star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
West-ward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light.

Glorious now, behold Him arise,
King and God and Sacrifice;
Alleluia, Alleluia!
Earth to the heav'ns replies.

O Star of wonder, Star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
West-ward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light.

22  A Christmas Night carol

All God's people come and bring
Praises to the newborn King,
Join together now and sing
At Jesus' birth.

Jesus born as Mary's son
Angels sing and shepherds run
To Bethlehem to greet the one
Who came to save.

Those whose lives with gladness ring,
Those in pain and suffering,
Those in fear and those in sin,
He calls us all.

Jesus born as Mary's son
Angels sing and shepherds run
To Bethlehem to greet the one
Who came to save.

Men of war now cease your fight
Come with us this Christmas night,
Kneel before God?s one true light
The Prince of Peace.

Jesus born as Mary's son
Angels sing and shepherds run
To Bethlehem to greet the one
Who came to save.

So we all with hearts aflame
Raise our voices praise His Name,
King of Kings, yet poor He came,
The newborn child

Jesus born as Mary's son
Angels sing and shepherds run
To Bethlehem to greet the one
Who came to save.

23  Joy Has Dawned Upon The World

Joy has dawned upon the world,
promised from creation:
God's salvation now unfurled,
hope for ev'ry nation.
Not with fanfares from above,
not with scenes of glory,
but a humble gift of love:
Jesus born of Mary

Sounds of wonder fill the sky
with the songs of angels,
as the mighty Prince of Life
shelters in a stable.
Hands that set each star in place,
shaped the earth in darkness,
cling now to a mother's breast,
vulnerable and helpless.

Shepherds bow before the Lamb,
gazing at the glory;
gifts of men from distant lands
prophesy the story.
Gold, a king is born to day,
incense, God is with us,
myrrh, His death will make a way,
by His blood He'll win us.

Son of Adam,
Son of heaven,
given as a ransom,
reconciling God and man,
Christ our mighty Champion!
What a Saviour,
what a Friend,
what a glorious mystery:
once a babe in Bethlehem,
Now the Lord of history.

25  Once A King Went Travelling

Once a King went travelling
Dressed in servant clothes,
Journeyed to a place foretold.
At His Father's bidding,
In the hush of night;
Come the hour, came the light.
Into a world where hope was gone
Came the light, came the light.
Into our hearts a lantern shone,
Came the light, came the light.

Lowly His beginning,
On a bed of straw,
Darkness all around He saw.
But not for the righteous,
In the hush of night;
Come the hour, came the light.
Into a world where hope was gone
Came the light, came the light.
Into our hearts a lantern shone,
Came the light, came the light.

Once my Lord did suffer,
So I'd suffer not,
Took our place upon the cross.
But no tomb could hold Him,
In the hush of night;
Come the hour, came the light.
Into a world where hope was gone
Came the light, came the light.
Into our hearts a lantern shone,
Came the light, came the light.

26  Offering

Over the skies of Bethlehem appeared a star
while angels sang to lowly shepherds
Three wise men seeking truth travelled from afar
hoping to find the Child from heaven
Falling on their knees they bowed before
the humble Prince of Peace

I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus may You receive the honour that You're due
O Lord I bring an offering to You,
I bring an offering to You

The sun cannot compare to the glory of Your love;
There is no shadow in Your presence
No mortal man would dare to stand before Your throne,
before the Holy One of heaven
It's only by Your blood and it's only through Your mercy,
Lord, I come

I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus may You receive the honour that You're due
O Lord I bring an offering to You,

I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus may You receive the honour that You're due

a King is born in Bethlehem
Our journey long, we seek the light
that leads to the hallowed manger ground
What fear we felt in the silent age
four hundred years can He be found
But broken by a baby's cry
rejoice in the hallowed manger ground
Emmanuel, Emmanuel
God incarnate here to dwell
Emmanuel, Emmanuel
Praise His Name Emmanuel

The son of God, here, born to bleed
a crown of thorns would pierce His brow
And we beheld this offering,
exalted now, the King of kings
Praise God for the hallowed manger ground
Emmanuel, Emmanuel
God incarnate here to dwell
Emmanuel, Emmanuel
Praise His Name Emmanuel
Praise His Name Emmanuel

28  O Come Be Born Again

Baby born in Bethlehem
Come be born in me again
Since You don't mind dirty stables
Here's my heart not fit or able
To receive such majesty
Still, You humbly come to me

O come, O come
O come, O come, be born again

Chosen One Who chose to be
Suff'ring Saviour, Servant King
Since You don?t despise the broken
Here's my life laid bare and open
To receive Your mercy
As Your Spirit calls to me
O come, O come
O come, O come, be born again

And all who struggle, all who sin
Come and become born again
Come and lay your heavy burdens
At the cross where all?s forgiven
At His feet new life begins
Come, O sinner and enter in

O come, Please come,
O come, O come, be born again

29  Good King Wenceslas

Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the Feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shone the moon that night,
Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gath?ring winter fuel.

Hither page, and stand by me,
If thou knows't it telling,
Yonder peasant who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right beneath the forest fence,
By St. Agnes' fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine,
Bring me pine logs hither:
Thou and I shall see him dine,
When we bear them thither.
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together;
Through the rude wind?s wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind grows stronger;
fails my heart I know not how;
I can go no longer.
Mark my footsteps, my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly;
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's steps he trod,
Where the snow lay dinted;
Heat was in the very sod
which the Saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure
wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor,
Shall yourself find blessing.

30  Aussie Jingle Bells

Dashing through the bush in a rusty Holden ute,
kickin' up the dust, Esky in the boot.
Kelpie by my side singing Christmas songs,
it's summer time and I am in my singlet, shorts and thongs.

Oh. Jingle bells, Jingle bells Jingle all the way
Christmas in Australia on a scorching Summers day, Oi!
Jingle bells, jongle bells, Christmas time is beut
Oh what fun it is to ride in a rusty Holden ute.

Engine's getting hot, we dodge the Kangaroos,
Swaggie climbs aboard - He is welcome too.
All the family is there, sitting by the pool,
Christmas day the Aussie way by the barbecue.

Oh. Jingle bells, Jingle bells Jingle all the way
Christmas in Australia on a scorching Summers day, Oi!
Jingle bells, jongle bells, Christmas time is beut
Oh what fun it is to ride in a rusty Holden ute.

Come the afternoon Grandpa has a doze,
The kids and Uncle Bruce are swimming in their clothes,
The time comes 'round to go, we take a family snap,
we pack the car and all shoot through
before the washing up

Oh. Jingle bells, Jingle bells Jingle all the way
Christmas in Australia on a scorching Summers day, Oi!
Jingle bells, jongle bells, Christmas time is beut
Oh what fun it is to ride in a rusty Holden ute.

Carol 31  Merry Christmas

Sun gleams bright, Hearts are light,
Merry, merry Christmas.
Bells Ring out, Children shout
Merry, merry, merry Christmas.
Sheep in fold, Shine like gold,
As the day is dawning.
Riding by, Stockmen cry
"Welcome, Christmas morning."

Golden day. When we say
Merry, merry Christmas
In the street, Where we meet,
Merry, merry, merry Christmas.
And with pride, Far and wide,
All our homes adorning,
Earth and sky, Sound the cry,
"Welcome, Christmas morning."

So with Joy, Man and boy,
Sing with us together;
On this morn, Christ was born.
Merry, merry, merry Christmas.
Raise the song, Loud and strong,
In the shining weather.
Joys bells ring, Christ the King,
Merry, merry, merry Christmas.

Carol 32  The Three Drovers

Across the plains one Christmas night,
three drovers riding blythe and gay,
looked up and saw a starry light,
more radiant than the Milky Way;
And on their hearts such wonder fell,
they sang with joy, Noel! Noel!
Noel! Noel! Noel!

The air was dry with the Summer heat
and smoke was on the yellow moon;
But from the heavens, faint and sweet,
came floating down a wondrous tune
and as they heard, they sang full well,
those drovers three, Noel! Noel!
Noel! Noel! Noel!

The black swans flew across the sky,
the wild dog called across the plain,
the starry lustre blazed on high,
still echoed on the Heavenly strain;
And still they sang, Noel! Noel!
Those drovers three, Noel! Noel!
Noel! Noel! Noel!
