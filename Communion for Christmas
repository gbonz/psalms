Home Communion for Christmas

The Greeting and Prayers

The people who walked in darkness 

have seen a great light;

for unto us a child is born,

unto us a son is given. 

Isaiah 9: 2,6 


I bring you good news 

   of great joy for all people:
   
   to you is born this day 
   
   in the city of David, 
   
   a Saviour, Christ the Lord
   
      Luke 2:10-11

Let us pray.

God of Israel, 

  with expectant hearts
  
  we Your people
  
  have waited for Christ's coming.
  
As one Who came in humility,

  so now may He come in glory,
  
  that He may make all things perfect
  
  in Your everlasting kingdom.
  
For He is Lord for ever and ever.  Amen.



The Collect of the Day

All glory to You, gracious God, 

   for the gift of Your Son, Whom You sent to save us.
   
   With the angels let us praise Your Name,
   
   and tell the earth His story,
   
   that all may believe, rejoice,
   
   and proclaim Your love,
   
   through Jesus Christ our Lord.    Amen.

A homily may be given


The Prayers

Almighty God,

   Your Son, Jesus Christ,
   
   has promised that You will hear us when we ask in faith:
   
   receive the prayers we offer:

Prayers may be made for particular needs, finishing with the Lordâ€™s Prayer.




Accept our prayers through

   Jesus Christ our Lord,
   
   who taught us to pray, 

Our Father in heaven,

hallowed be Your Name,

Your kingdom come,

Your will be done,

on earth as in heaven. 

Give us today our daily bread.

Forgive us our sins

as we forgive those who sin against us. 

Save us from the time of trial

and deliver us from evil.

For the kingdom, the power, and the glory 

are Yours now and for ever. Amen.

Preparation for The Lord?s Supper

Christ the grace of God has dawned upon the world 

with healing for all.

Let us bring our weaknesses and infirmities to Him, 

confessing our sins in penitence and faith.

Merciful God, our  maker and our judge,

   we have sinned against You 
   
   in thought, word, and deed,
   
   and in what we have failed to do :
   
   we have not loved You with our whole heart;
   
   we have not loved our neighbours as ourselves;
   
   we repent, and are sorry for all our sins.
   
  Father, forgive us.
  
   Strengthen us to love and obey You 
   
      in newness of life;
   through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Amen.


The Absolution.  Standing, the priest says

God is slow to anger and full of compassion,

   forgiving all who humbly repent
   
   and trust in His Son as Saviour and Lord.
   
   God therefore forgives you in Christ Jesus,
   
      in Whom there is no condemnation.  Amen.

The Greeting of Peace.

The Greeting of Peace is introduced with these words.

   Glory to God in the highest 
   
      On earth peace among 
      
      those whom He favours.      (Luke 2:14)

   The peace of the Lord be always with you.
   
      And also with you.


The Great Thanksgiving 

Lift up your hearts.

      We lift them to the Lord. 

Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.

      It is right to give our thanks and praise.

All glory and honour, thanks and praise

   be given to You at all times and in all places,
   
   Lord, Holy Father, true and living God.

We give You thanks and praise for Your Son;

   our Saviour Jesus Christ,
   
   Who by the power of Your Spirit, was born of Mary
   
   and lived as one of us.
   
   In Your Word made flesh
   
   You have caused a new light to shine in our hearts,
   
   to give knowledge of Your glory
   
   in the face of Jesus Christ.
   
By His death on the cross

   and rising to new life,
   
   He offered the one true sacrifice for sin
   
   and obtained an eternal deliverance for His people.

Therefore with angels and archangels,

   and with all the company of heaven,
   
   we proclaim Your great and glorious Name,
   
   for ever praising You and saying:

Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might, 

   heaven and earth are full of Your glory. 
   
   Hosanna in the highest.

And now, gracious God, 

   we thank You for these gifts of bread and wine, 
   
   and pray that we who receive them, 
   
   in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, 
   
   according to our Saviour's word, 
   
   in remembrance of His suffering and death,
   
   may share His body and blood.

On the night before He died, Jesus took bread, 

   and when He had given You thanks He broke it,
   
   and gave it to His disciples, saying, ?Take and eat. 
   
   This is My body which is given for you. 
   
   Do this in remembrance of Me.?

After supper, He took the cup,

   and again giving You thanks
   
   he gave it to His disciples, saying,
   
   ?Drink from this, all of You.
   
   This is My blood of the new covenant
   
   which is shed for you and for many
   
   for the forgiveness of sins.
   
   Do this, as often as you drink it, 
   
   in remembrance of Me.?


We eat this bread and drink this cup

   to proclaim the death of the Lord. 
   
We do this until He returns.

   Come, Lord Jesus!

Father, 

  as we recall His saving death 
  
  and glorious resurrection,
  
  may we who share these gifts
  
  be renewed by Your Holy Spirit
  
  and united in the body of Your Son. 

Bring us with all Your people

  into the joy of Your eternal kingdom,
  
  there to feast at Your table and
  
  join in Your eternal praise:

Worthy is the Lamb, Who was slain,

   to receive praise and honour 
   
   and glory and power 
   
   for ever and ever.  Amen.



After the Communion

God of heaven, dwelling among us,

   we thank You for feeding us with this holy food.
   
   By Your grace keep us ever faithful 
   
   to Your Word made flesh
   
   that as His body in the world
   
   we may bring Your presence to all people

Father,

   we offer ourselves to you
   
   as a living sacrifice
   
   through Jesus Christ our Lord.
   
   Send us out in the power of Your Spirit
   
   to live and work to Your praise and glory.
