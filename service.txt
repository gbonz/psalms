the service for 3rd order of holy communion


the greeting and prayers


   the lord be with you

      and also with you

   our lord jesus christ said

   you shall love the lord your god

   with all your heart, and with all your soul,

   and with all your mind,

   and with all your strength.

   this is the great and first commandment.

   and a second is like it:

   you shall love your neighbour as yourself.

   on these two commandments

   hang all the law and the prophets.

matthew 22.37-40, Mark 12.30-31



   let us pray.

      almighty God,

      to Whom all hearts are open,

      all desires known,

      and from Whom no secrets are hidden:

      cleanse the thoughts of our hearts

      by the inspiration of Your holy spirit,

      that we may perfectly love You,

      and worthily magnify Your holy name,

      through christ our lord. amen.

preparation for The lord's supper

   we are god's children now,

   and what we will be

   has not yet been made known.

   but we know that when He appears

   we shall be like Him,
 
   for we shall see Him as He is.

   all who have this hope in Him

   purify themselves, just as he is pure.
    
1 John 3.2-3



a time of silence may follow.


   knowing the goodness of god

   and our failure to respond

   with love and obedience,

   let us confess our sins,

   saying together,

      heavenly father,

     you have loved us with an everlasting love,

     but we have broken your holy laws

     and have left undone

     what we ought to have done.

     we are sorry for our sins

     and turn away from them.

     for the sake of your son Who died for us,

     forgive us, cleanse us and change us.

     by Your holy spirit,

     enable us to live for You;

     through jesus christ our lord. amen.


the priest declares god's forgiveness.


   god is slow to anger and full of compassion,

   forgiving all who humbly repent

   and trust in His Son as Saviour and lord.

   god therefore forgives you in christ jesus,

   in whom there is no condemnation.  amen.


one or more of the following passages may also be read


   as an assurance of god's forgiveness.

   god so loved the world

   that he gave his only son,

   so that everyone who believes in Him

   may not perish but may have eternal life.    

John 3.16


   as far as the east is from the west,

   so far has God removed our sins from us.     

psalm 103.12


   our lord jesus christ himself

   bore our sins in His body on the cross,

   so that we might die to sin

   and live for righteousness;

   by his wounds you have been healed.

1 Peter 2.24


   the peace of the lord be always with you.

      and also with you.



the great thanksgiving

   lift up your hearts.

      We lift them to the Lord.

   let us give thanks to the Lord our god.

      it is right to give our thanks and praise.

   you are worthy, our lord and god,

   to receive glory and honour and power,

   for You created all things,

   making us in Your own image.

   we praise You for Your Son,

   our Saviour Jesus Christ,

   Who by His death on the cross

   and rising to new life

   offered the one true sacrifice for sin

   and obtained an eternal deliverance for His people.

  therefore, we lift our voices to praise You, saying,

     holy, holy, holy lord,

     god of power and might,

     heaven and earth are full of Your glory.

     hosanna in the highest.



   and now, gracious god,

   we thank You for these gifts of bread and wine,

   and pray that we who receive them,

   in the fellowship of the holy spirit,

   according to our saviour's word,

   in remembrance of His suffering and death,

   may share His body and blood.



   on the night before He died, jesus took bread,

   and when He had given You thanks He broke it,

   and gave it to His disciples, saying,

   "take and eat.

   this is My body which is given for you.

   do this in remembrance of me."



   after supper, he took the cup,

   and again giving You thanks

   he gave it to His disciples, saying,

   "drink from this, all of you.

   this is My blood of the new covenant

   which is shed for you and for many

   for the forgiveness of sins.

   do this, as often as you drink it,

   in remembrance of Me."

   we eat this bread and drink this cup

   to proclaim the death of the lord.

   we do this until he returns.

     come, lord jesus!

   father, as we recall His saving death

   and glorious resurrection,

   may we who share these gifts

   be renewed by Your Holy Spirit

   and united in the body of Your Son.

   bring us with all Your people

   into the joy of Your eternal kingdom,

   there to feast at Your table and

   join in Your eternal praise:

   worthy is the lamb, Who was slain,

   to receive praise and honour

   and glory and power

   for ever and ever. Amen.



the minister gives an invitation to communion



after the communion

      gracious god,

      thank You for feeding us

      with the spiritual food

      of the body and blood

      of our Saviour Jesus Christ.

      thank You for assuring us

      of Your goodness and love,

      and that we are living members of christ's body.

      father, we offer ourselves to You

      as a living sacrifice through jesus christ our lord.

      send us out in the power of your spirit

      to live and work to Your praise and glory.



the blessing


   the peace of God,

   which passes all understanding,

   keep your hearts and minds

   in the knowledge and love of God,

   and his son, jesus christ our lord;

   and the blessing of God almighty,

   the father the son and the holy spirit,

   be among you and remain with you always.

  amen.
