The Service for 3rd Order of Holy Communion

The Greeting and Prayers

The Lord be with you
  And Also with you

Our Lord Jesus Christ said:
You shall love the Lord your God
  with all your heart, and with all your soul,
  and with all your mind,
  and with all your strength.

This is the great and first commandment.
And a second is like it:
  You shall love your neighbour as yourself.

On these two commandments
  hang all the law and the prophets.
     Matthew 22.37-40, Mark 12.30-31

Let us pray.
Almighty God,
  to Whom all hearts are open,
  all desires known,
  and from Whom no secrets are hidden:
  cleanse the thoughts of our hearts
  by the inspiration of Your Holy Spirit,
  that we may perfectly love You,
  and worthily magnify Your holy Name,
  through Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Collect of the Day

The following or another seasonal Collect is read

Lord God, Who wonderfully created us
  and even more wonderfully
  restored our humanity:
  strengthen us by Your Holy Spirit
  to triumph over suffering and death,
  and grant us eternal joy;
  through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Amen.

The readings appropriate to the day are read.

A homily may be given

The Prayers

Prayers may be made for particular needs,
 finishing with the Lord's Prayer.


Accept our prayers
  through Jesus Christ our Lord,
  Who taught us to pray,

Our Father in heaven,
  hallowed be Your Name,
  Your kingdom come,
  Your will be done,
  on earth as in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins
  as we forgive those who sin against us.
Save us from the time of trial
  and deliver us from evil.
For the kingdom, the power, and the glory
  are Yours now and for ever. Amen.

Preparation for The Lord's Supper

We are God's children now,
 and what we will be
  has not yet been made known.
But we know that when He appears
  we shall be like Him,
   for we shall see Him as He is.
All who have this hope in Him
  purify themselves, just as he is pure.
    1 John 3.2-3


  A time of silence may follow.


Knowing the goodness of God
  and our failure to respond
  with love and obedience,
  let us confess our sins,
   saying together,

Heavenly Father,
  You have loved us with an everlasting love,
  but we have broken Your holy laws
  and have left undone
  what we ought to have done.
We are sorry for our sins
  and turn away from them.
For the sake of Your Son Who died for us,
  forgive us, cleanse us and change us.
By Your Holy Spirit,
  enable us to live for You;
  through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The priest declares God's forgiveness.
God is slow to anger and full of compassion,
  forgiving all who humbly repent
  and trust in His Son as Saviour and Lord.
  God therefore forgives you in Christ Jesus,
  in Whom there is no condemnation.  Amen.

One or more of the following passages
may also be read
as an assurance of God's forgiveness.

God so loved the world
  that He gave His only Son,
  so that everyone who believes in Him
  may not perish but may have eternal life.    John 3.16

As far as the east is from the west,
  so far has God removed our sins from us.     Psalm 103.12

Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself
  bore our sins in His body on the cross,
  so that we might die to sin
  and live for righteousness;
  by His wounds you have been healed.
    1 Peter 2.24


The peace of the Lord be always with you.
     And also with you.



The Great Thanksgiving

Lift up your hearts.
  We lift them to the Lord.

Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
  It is right to give our thanks and praise.


You are worthy, our Lord and God,
  to receive glory and honour and power,
  for You created all things,
  making us in Your own image.

We praise You for Your Son,
  our Saviour Jesus Christ,
  Who by His death on the cross
  and rising to new life
  offered the one true sacrifice for sin
  and obtained an eternal deliverance for His people.

Therefore, we lift our voices to praise You, saying,
Holy, holy, holy Lord,
  God of power and might,
  heaven and earth are full of Your glory.
  Hosanna in the highest.


And now, gracious God,
  we thank You for these gifts of bread and wine,
  and pray that we who receive them,
  in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
  according to our Saviour's word,
  in remembrance of His suffering and death,
  may share His body and blood.


On the night before He died, Jesus took bread,
  and when He had given You thanks He broke it,
  and gave it to His disciples, saying,
  "Take and eat.
  This is My body which is given for you.
  Do this in remembrance of Me."

After supper, He took the cup,
  and again giving You thanks
  He gave it to His disciples, saying,
  "Drink from this, all of you.
  This is My blood of the new covenant
  which is shed for you and for many
  for the forgiveness of sins.
  Do this, as often as you drink it,
  in remembrance of Me."

We eat this bread and drink this cup
  to proclaim the death of the Lord.
We do this until He returns.
  Come, Lord Jesus!

Father,
  as we recall His saving death
  and glorious resurrection,
  may we who share these gifts
  be renewed by Your Holy Spirit
  and united in the body of Your Son.

Bring us with all Your people
  into the joy of Your eternal kingdom,
  there to feast at Your table and
  join in Your eternal praise:

Worthy is the Lamb, Who was slain,
  to receive praise and honour
  and glory and power
  for ever and ever. Amen.


The minister gives an invitation to communion


After the Communion

Gracious God,
  thank You for feeding us
  with the spiritual food
  of the body and blood
  of our Saviour Jesus Christ.
Thank You for assuring us
  of Your goodness and love,
  and that we are living members
    of Christ's body.

Father, we offer ourselves to You
  as a living sacrifice
  through Jesus Christ our Lord.
  Send us out in the power of Your Spirit
  to live and work to Your praise and glory.


The Blessing

The peace of God,
  which passes all understanding,
  keep your hearts and minds
  in the knowledge and love of God,
  and His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord;
And the blessing of God almighty,
  The Father the Son and the Holy Spirit,
  be among you and remain with you always.
  Amen.
