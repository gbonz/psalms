001 Come, Now Is The Time To Worship

Come, now is the time to worship.
Come, now is the time to give your heart.
Come, just as you are to worship.
Come, just as you are before your God.
Come!

One day every tongue will confess You are God
One day every knee will bow
Still; the greatest treasure remains for those
Who gladly choose You now.

Come, now is the time to worship.
Come, now is the time to give your heart.
Come, just as you are to worship.

Come!

One day every tongue will confess You are God

Still; the greatest treasure remains for those
Who gladly choose You now.

003 The Lord Is My Shepherd

The Lord is my Shepherd and I want to follow,
Wherever He leads, wherever He goes.
Over the mountains, the waters and byways,
Valleys and highways, Hes waiting for me.

Chorus
I want to go to meet Him there,
To lay myself down in His love.
The Lord is my Shepherd and I want to follow,
Wherever He leads me, wherever He goes.

And while on the journey to where we are going,
He promised to be there to help us along,
And over the mountains, well walk on together,
To know all the wonders Hes given to me

Chorus
I want to go to meet Him there,
To lay myself down in His love.
The Lord is my Shepherd and I want to follow,
Wherever He leads me, wherever He goes.

Though the fig tree does not blossom,
and there be no fruit on the vines;
the produce of the olive fails,
and the fields yield no food,
though the flock be cut off from the fold
and there be no herd in the stall;

Yet will I rejoice in the Lord.
Yet will I rejoice in the Lord.

017 How Great Thou Art

O Lord my God, when I in awe-some wonder
Consider all the works Thy hands have made,
I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed!

Chorus:
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art!  How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art!  How great Thou art!

When through the woods and forest glades I wander
and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,
when I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze,

Chorus:
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art!  How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art!  How great Thou art!

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in.
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin!

Chorus:
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art!  How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art!  How great Thou art!

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
and there proclaim, My God, how great Thou art!

Chorus:
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art!  How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art!  How great Thou art!

And the rough ways shall be made smooth
And all flesh shall see the salvation of God

Reap in mercy
Break up your fallow ground
For it is time to seek the Lord
Till He comes to rain
Righteousness on you

030 The Compassion Hymn

There is an everlasting kindness
You lavished on us
When the radiance of heaven
Came to rescue the lost;
You called the sheep without a shepherd
To leave their distress
For Your streams of forgiveness
And the shade of Your rest.

And with compassion for the hurting,
You reached out Your hand
As the lame ran to meet You
And the dead breathed again;
You saw behind the eyes of sorrow
And shared in our tears,
Heard the sigh of the weary,
Let the children draw near.

Chorus
What boundless love,
What fathomless grace
You have shown us, O God of compassion!
Each day we live
An offering of praise
As we show to the world Your compassion.

We stood beneath the cross of Calvary
And gazed on Your face
At the thorns of oppression
And the wounds of disgrace,
For surely You have borne our suffering
And carried our grief
As You pardoned the scoffer
And showed grace to the thief.

Chorus
What boundless love,
What fathomless grace
You have shown us, O God of compassion!
Each day we live
An offering of praise
As we show to the world Your compassion.

How beautiful the feet that carry
This gospel of peace
To the fields of injustice
And the valleys of need
To be a voice of hope and healing,
To answer the cries
Of the hungry and helpless
With the mercy of Christ.

Chorus
What boundless love,
What fathomless grace
You have shown us, O God of compassion!
Each day we live
An offering of praise
As we show to the world Your compassion.

As pants the hart for cooling streams,
When heated in the chase,
So longs my soul, O God, for You,
And Your refreshing grace.

For You, my God, the living God,
My thirsty soul does pine;
O when shall I behold Your face,
Your majesty divine

God of my strength, how long shall I,
Like one forgotten, mourn?
Forlorn, forsaken, and exposed
To my oppressors scorn.

Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
Hope still, and I shall sing
The praise of Him who is My God,
My healths eternal spring.

Glory in the highest I will shout and sing,
Standing on the promises of God.

Chorus
Standing, standing
Standing on the promises of God my Saviour

When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,
By the living word of God I shall prevail
Standing on the promises of God.

Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me;
Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally by loves strong chord,
Overcoming daily with the Spirits sword
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing, standing
Standing on the promises of God my Saviour
Standing, standing
Im standing on the promises of God

Standing on the promises I cannot fall,
Listning ev'ry moment for the Spirits call,
Resting in my Saviour as my all in all,
Standing on the promises of God.

Chorus
Standing, standing
Standing on the promises of God my Saviour

034 Amazing Grace

Amazing Grace!  How sweet the sound.
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found.
Was blind, but now I see.

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
and grace my fears relieved:
How precious did that grace appear
the hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
and grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me.
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
as long as life endures.

Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
and mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil
a life of joy and peace.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow;
the sun forbear to shine;
but God Who called me here below,
will be forever mine.

When Ive been there ten thousand years,
bright shining as the sun,
Ive no less days to sing Gods praise
than when I first begun.

035 Crimson Stream

There is a crimson stream
That washes white as snow
A love that longs to know me as Your own
This hope, the Light of Life
This grace that wont let go
This fire that burns can change a heart of stone

Nothing can stop this love from reaching me
Nothing can keep Your blood from cleansing me
Nothing can change Your mercies, new each day
Oh I believe in You
My Jesus I will give my heart to You

No shame can keep me bound
No sin can own the keys
The price was paid in full to set me free
No more these filthy rags
Im clothed in purity
My Saviours righteousness is mine to keep

Nothing can stop this love from reaching me
Nothing can keep Your blood from cleansing me
Nothing can change Your mercies, new each day
Oh I believe in You
My Jesus I will give my heart to You

036 There Is A Hope

There is a hope that burns within my heart,
that gives me strength for evry passing day:
a glimpse of glory now revealed in meagre part,
yet drives all doubt away:
I stand in Christ with sins forgivn;
and Christ in me, the hope of heavn!
My highest calling and my deepest joy,
to make His will my home

There is a hope that lifts my weary head,
A consolation strong against despair,
That when the world has plunged me in its deepest pit,
I find the Saviour there!
Through present sufferings, future's fear,
He whispers 'courage' in my ear.
For I am safe in everlasting arms,
And they will lead me home.

There is a hope that stands the test of time,
That lifts my eyes beyond the beckoning grave,
To see the matchless beauty of a day divine
When I behold His face!
When sufferings cease and sorrows die,
And every longing satisfied.
Then joy unspeakable will flood my soul,
For I am truly home.

My Jesus, my Saviour,
Lord, there is none like You.
All of my days
I want to praise
the wonders of Your mighty love.

My comfort, my shelter,
tower of refuge and strength,
let every breath,
all that I am,
never cease to worship You.

Shout to the Lord,
all the earth, let us sing
power and majesty, praise to the King.
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
at the sound of Your name.
I sing for joy
at the work of Your hands.
For ever I'll love You, for ever I'll stand.
Nothing compares to the promise
I have in You.

044 My Living Hope

You knew the path before You
In the garden You shed tears
You endured the lash and took my shame
My cross You chose to bear
Your love shown in Your actions
My debt now washed away
You give life, to all who believe
Who trust You and obey

When Satan tries to snare me
And he tries to pull me down
Its enough to know Youre with me
That Youll lift me to safe ground
I find comfort in Your love
I find shelter in Your wings
Your strength is all I need
For when Im weak, I am strong

As I run the race before me
With my eyes only on You
May You strengthen me and guide me
May I long to live for You
I will run and not grow weary
I will walk and not be faint
You uphold me and sustain me
Youre my Hope, my Lord
I will run and not grow weary
I will walk and not be faint
You uphold me and sustain me
Youre my Hope, my Lord, my Life.

046 The God of Abraham Praise

The God of Abraham praise,
Who reigns enthroned above,
Ancient of everlasting days,
And God of love.
Jehovah!  Great I AM!
By earth and heaven confessed;
I bow and bless the sacred Name
For ever blessed.

The God of Abraham praise,
At Whose supreme command
From earth I rise, and seek the joys
At His right hand.
I all on earth forsake -
Its wisdom, fame, and power -
And Him my only portion make,
My shield and tower.

Though natures strength decay;
And earth and hell withstand;
To Canaan's bounds I urge my way
At His command.
The watery deep I pass,
With Jesus in my view,
And through the howling wilderness
My way pursue.

The God of Abraham praise,
Whose all sufficient grace
Shall guide me all my happy days
In all my ways
He calls a worm His friend,
He calls Himself my God;
And He shall save me to the end
Through Jesus blood

He by Himself hath sworn,
I on His oath depend:
I shall, on eagles wings upborne,
To heaven ascend;
I shall behold His face,
I shall His power adore,
And sing the wonders of His grace
For evermore.

The whole triumphant host
Gives thanks to God on high;
Hail! Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
They ever cry.
Hail! Abrahams God and mine;
I join the heavenly lay:
All might and majesty are Thine
And endless praise.

For giving us Your Son;
Sending Him into the world,

Knowing we would bruise Him
And smite Him from the earth.

In His death is my birth;
Hallelujah, my Father,
In His life is my life.

And that cannot fail.

Above all powers
Above all kings
Above all nature and all created things
Above all wisdom all the ways of man
You were here before the world began

Above all kingdoms
Above all thrones
Above all wonders the world has ever known
Above all wealth and treasures of the Earth
Theres no way to measure what Youre worth

Laid behind the stone
You lived to die
Rejected and alone
Like a Rose
Trampled on the ground
You took the fall
And thought of me

061 Meekness And Majesty

Meekness and Majesty,
Manhood and Deity,
In perfect harmony
The Man Who is God.
Lord of eternity
Dwells in humanity,
Kneels in humility
And washes our feet

Chorus
O what a mystery,
Meekness and majesty
Bow down and worship
For this is your God.
This is your God.

Fathers pure radiance,
Perfect in innocence,
Yet learns obedience
To death on a cross.
Suffering to give us life,
Conquering through sacrifice,
And as they crucify
Prays, Father forgive!

Chorus
O what a mystery,
Meekness and majesty
Bow down and worship
For this is your God.
This is your God.

Wisdom unsearchable,
God the invisible
Love indestructible
In frailty appears.
Lord of infinity
Stooping so tenderly
Lifts our humanity
To the heights of His throne

Chorus
O what a mystery,
Meekness and majesty
Bow down and worship
For this is your God.
This is your God.

062 O Righteous God

O righteous God Who searches minds and hearts,
Bring to an end the violence of my foes,
And make the righteous more secure,
O righteous God.

Sing praise to the Name of the Lord most high.
Sing praise to the Name of the Lord most high.
Give thanks to the Lord Who rescues me,

O Lord my God, I take refuge in You;
Save and deliver me from all my foes.
My shield is God the Lord most high,
O Lord my God.

Sing praise to the Name of the Lord most high.
Sing praise to the Name of the Lord most high.
Give thanks to the Lord Who rescues me,
O righteous God.

I want to walk with Jesus Christ,
All the days I live of this life on earth,
To give to Him complete control
Of body and of soul.

Follow Him, follow Him,
Yield Your life to Him,
He has conquered death,
He is King of kings.
Accept the joy
Which He gives to those
Who yield their lives to Him.

I want to learn to speak to Him,
To pray to Him, confess my sin,
To open my life and let Him in,
For joy will then be mine.

My life must show that He lives in me.
My deeds, my thoughts, my words must speak
All of His love for me.

Follow Him, follow Him,
Yield Your life to Him,
He has conquered death,
He is King of kings.

For this is how I know the way
To live my life as pleases Him,
In holiness and joy.

Take full control of my selfish will
And make me wholly Thine.

He is King of kings.
Accept the joy
Which He gives to those
Who yield their lives to Him.

064 Say It loud

Far and near, hear the call,
Worship Him, Lord of all;
Families of nations come,
Celebrate what God has done

Deep and wide is the love
Heaven sent from above;
Gods own Son for sinners died,
Rose again, He is alive

Chorus
Say it loud, say it strong
Tell the world what God has done;
Say it loud, praise His Name,
Let the earth rejoice
For the Lord reigns.

At His Name let praise begin
Oceans roar, nature sing.
For He comes, to judge the earth
In righteousness and in His truth.

Chorus
Say it loud, say it strong
Tell the world what God has done;
Say it loud, praise His Name,

065 I Will Offer up My Life

I will offer up my life
In spirit and truth,
Pouring out the oil of love
As my worship to You.
In surrender I must give
My every part;
Lord, receive the sacrifice
Of a broken heart.

Chorus
Jesus, what can I give
What can I bring
To so faithful a friend
To so loving a King
Saviour, what can be said
What can be sung
As a praise of Your Name
For the things You have done
Oh, my words could not tell
Not even in part
Of the debt of love that is owed
By this thankful heart

You deserve my every breath
For Youve paid the great cost;
Giving up Your life to death,
Even death on a cross.
You took all my shame away,
There defeated my sin,
Opened up the gates of heaven,
And have beckoned me in.

Chorus
Jesus, what can I give
What can I bring
To so faithful a friend
To so loving a King
Saviour, what can be said
What can be sung
As a praise of Your Name
For the things You have done
Oh, my words could not tell
Not even in part
Of the debt of love that is owed
By this thankful heart

Draw me close to You,
never let me go.
I lay it all down again,
to hear You say that I'm Your friend.

You are my desire,
no one else will do,
'cause nothing else could take Your place,
to feel the warmth of Your embrace.
Help me find the way,
bring me back to You.

You're all I want,
You're all I've ever needed.
You're all I want,
help me know You are near.

068 Let Us Love And Sing And Wonder

Let us love, and sing and wonder,
Let us praise the Saviours Name!
He has hushed the Laws loud thunder.
He has quenched Mount Sinais flame:
He has washed us with His blood.
He has brought us nigh to God.
He has washed us with His blood.
He has brought us nigh to God.

Let us love the Lord Who bought us.
Pitied us when enemies,
Called us by His grace, and taught us,
Gave us ears and gave us eyes:
He has washed us with His blood,
He presents our souls to God.
He has washed us with His blood,
He presents our souls to God.

Let us sing, though fierce temptations
Threaten hard to bear us down!
For the Lord, our strong salvation,
Holds in view the conquerors crown:
He Who washed us with His blood
Soon will bring us home to God.
He Who washed us with His blood
Soon will bring us home to God.

Let us wonder, grace and justice
Join, and point to mercys store;
When through grace in Christ our trust is,
Justice smiles, and asks no more.
He Who washed us with His blood
Has secured our way to God.
He Who washed us with His blood
Has secured our way to God.

Let us praise, and join the chorus
Of the saints enthroned on high;
Here they trusted Him before us,
Now their praises fill the sky:
You have washed us with Your blood;
You are worthy, Lamb of God.
You have washed us with Your blood;
You are worthy, Lamb of God.

Though my flesh it be destroyed
Yet with my eyes I will see God

Chorus
For I know that my Redeemer lives
And I will stand with Him on that day

Though my flesh it be destroyed
Yet with my eyes I will see God

070 River Of Fire

Who paints the skies into glorious day?
Only the splendour of Jesus.
Who breathes His life into fists of clay?
Only the splendour of Jesus.
Who shapes the valleys and brings the rain?
Only the splendour of Jesus.
Who makes the desert to live again?
Only the splendour of Jesus.

Teach every nation His marvellous ways;
Each generation shall sing His praise.

Chorus
He is wonderful, He is glorious,
Clothed in righteousness,
Full of tenderness.
Come and worship Him,
Hes the Prince of life,
He will cleanse our hearts
In His river of fire

Who hears the cry of the barren one?
Only the mercy of Jesus.
Who breaks the curse of the heart of stone?
Only the mercy of Jesus.
Who storms the prison and sets men free,
Only the mercy of Jesus.
Purchasing souls for eternity?
Only the mercy of Jesus.

Teach every nation His marvellous ways;
Each generation shall sing His praise.

Chorus
He is wonderful, He is glorious,
Clothed in righteousness,
Full of tenderness.
Come and worship Him,
Hes the Prince of life,
He will cleanse our hearts

We are heirs of the Father
We are joint heirs with the Son
We are children of the kingdom
We are family we are one.

We are washed, we are sanctified,
We are cleansed by the blood;
We are born of the Spirit:
We are children of the Lord.

We are members of His body;
We are objects of His love;
We're partakers of His holiness:
We are citizens of Heav'n above.

We're partakers of His suffering,-
We're partakers of His grace.
We shall be changed to be like Him
When we see Him face to face.

We are longing for His coming,
We are looking to the skies.
We are watching, We are waiting:
We shall fly with Him! We shall rise!

We shall reign with Him forever!
Men and angels shout and sing!
All dominion shall be given
To the family of the King!

074 Light Up The Fire

Colours of day
dawn into the mind,
The sun has come up,
the night is behind.
Go down in the city,
into the street,
And lets give the message
to the people we meet.

Chorus
So light up the fire
and let the flame burn,
Open the door,
let Jesus return.
Take seeds of His Spirit,
let the fruit grow,
Tell the people of Jesus,
and let His love show.

Go through the park,
on into the town;
The sun still shines on;
it never goes down.
The Light of the world
is risen again;
The people of darkness
are needing a friend

Chorus
So light up the fire
and let the flame burn,
Open the door,
let Jesus return.
Take seeds of His Spirit,
let the fruit grow,
Tell the people of Jesus,
and let His love show.

Open your eyes,
look into the sky,
The darkness has come,
the sun came to die.
The evening draws on,
the sun disappears,
But Jesus is living,
His Spirit is near.

Chorus
So light up the fire
and let the flame burn,
Open the door,
let Jesus return.
Take seeds of His Spirit,
let the fruit grow,
Tell the people of Jesus,
and let His love show.

Chorus
So light up the fire

075 It Is Well With My Soul

When peace like a river
 attendeth my way,
when sorrows like sea-billows roll,
whatever my lot,
 You have taught me to know,
It is well,
 it is well with my soul.

Chorus
It is well,
With my soul,
It is well,
it is well with my soul.

Though Satan should buffet,
 though trials should come
let this blest assurance control,
that Christ has regarded
 my helpless estate,
and has shed His own blood
 for my soul.

Chorus
It is well,
With my soul,
It is well,
it is well with my soul.

My sin, oh the bliss
 of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to His cross,
 and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord,
 praise the Lord, O my soul!

Chorus
It is well,
With my soul,
It is well,
it is well with my soul.

For me be it Christ,
 be it Christ, hence to live!
If Jordan above me shall roll,
no pang shall be mine,
 for in death as in life,
You will whisper Your peace
 to my soul.

Chorus
It is well,
With my soul,
It is well,
it is well with my soul.

But, Lord, its for You,
 for Your coming we wait,
the sky, not the grave is our goal;
oh, trump of the angel!
 O voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope!
 Blessed rest of my soul!

Chorus
It is well,
With my soul,
It is well,
it is well with my soul.

Through Your love and through the ram

Turned the sea into dry land.

You were the God Who really sees,
And by Your might You set Your children free.

Through the years You made it clear
That the time of Christ was near,
Though the people couldnt see
What Messiah ought to be.
Though Your word contained the plan,
They just could not understand
Your most awesome work was done
Through the frailty of Your Son.

081 Awesome God

When He rolls up His sleeves
He aint just putting on the ritz,
Our God is an awesome God.
Theres thunder in His footsteps
and lightning in His fists,
Our God is an awesome God.

And the Lord, He wasnt joking
when He kicked em out of Eden.
It wasnt for no reason that He shed His blood.
His return is very close
and so you better be believing that
Our God is an awesome God.

Chorus
Our God is an awesome God,
He reigns from heaven above,
With wisdom, power and love,
Our God is an awesome God!
Our God is an awesome God,
He reigns from heaven above,
With wisdom, power and love,
Our God is an awesome God!

And when the sky was starless
in the void of the night,
Our God is an awesome God.
He spoke into the darkness
and created the light,
Our God is an awesome God.

And judgement and wrath
He poured out on Sodom.
Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross.
I hope that we have not
too quickly forgotten that
Our God is an awesome God.

Chorus
Our God is an awesome God,
He reigns from heaven above,
With wisdom, power and love,
Our God is an awesome God!
Our God is an awesome God,
He reigns from heaven above,
With wisdom, power and love,
Our God is an awesome God!

083 Offering

Over the skies of Bethlehem appeared a star
while angels sang to lowly shepherds
Three wise men seeking truth travelled from afar
hoping to find the Child from Heaven
Falling on their knees they bowed before the
humble Prince of Peace

I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus may You receive the honour that Youre due
O Lord I bring an offering to You
I bring an offering to You

The sun cannot compare to the glory of Your love;
There is no shadow in Your presence
No mortal man would dare to stand before Your throne
Before the Holy One of Heaven
Its only by Your blood,
and its only through Your mercy,
Lord I come

I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus may You receive the honour that Youre due
O Lord I bring an offering to You

I bring an offering of worship to my King
No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
Jesus may You receive the honour that Youre due

O Lord I bring an offering to You
O Lord I bring an offering to You

084 A Frame So Beautifully Formed

A frame so beautifully formed,
brought to life by God's own breath.
Crafted from the planets dust,
God's own image carved in flesh.
But not one righteousness remains,
perfection lost, and beauty stained.
Far from the safety of God's side,
innocence traded for a lie.

All my shame,
all I've failed to be nailed upon a cross
and left at Calvary

A world of fabulous design,
yet scarred with misery and pain.
But underneath this brokenness,
our Maker's signature remains.
And only Your redeeming love
can pay the debt we can't afford.
Salvation worked by Your own hand,
Your broken workmanship restored.

All my shame,
all I've failed to be nailed upon a cross
and left at Calvary

All my shame,
all I've failed to be is nailed upon a cross
and left at Calvary

087 Christ Is Risen

In the tomb so cold they laid Him,
death its victim claimd.
Powrs of hell, they could not hold Him;
back to life He came!

Chorus
Christ is risen!
Death has been conquered
Christ is risen!
He shall reign for ever.

Hell had spent its fury on Him,
left Him crucified.
Yet, by blood, He boldly conquered,
sin and death defied.

Chorus
Christ is risen!
Death has been conquered
Christ is risen!
He shall reign for ever.

Now the fear of death is broken,
love has won the crown.
Prisners of the darkness listen,
walls are tumbling down.

Chorus
Christ is risen!
Death has been conquered
Christ is risen!
He shall reign for ever.

Raised from death to heaven ascending,
loves exulted King.
Let His song of joy, unending,
through the nations ring.

Chorus
Christ is risen!
Death has been conquered
Christ is risen!
He shall reign for ever.

Christ is risen!
Death has been conquered
Christ is risen!
He shall reign for ever.

088 Joy Has Dawned

Joy has dawned upon the world,
promised from creation:
Gods salvation now unfurled,
hope for evry nation.
Not with fanfares from above,
not  with scenes of glory,
but a humble gift of love:
Jesus born of Mary.

Sounds of wonder fill the sky
with the songs of Angels,
as the mighty Prince of Life
shelters in a stable.
Hands that set each star in place,
shaped the earth in darkness,
cling now to a mothers breast,
vulnerable and helpless.

Shepherds bow before the Lamb,
gazing at the glory;
Gifts of men from distant lands
prophesy the story.
Gold, a King is born today,
Incense, God is with us,
Myrrh, His death will make a way,
by His blood Hell win us.

Son of Adam, Son of heaven,
given as a ransom
Reconciling God and man,
Christ our mighty Champion!
What a Saviour, what a Friend
What a glorious mystery:
Once a babe in Bethlehem,
now the Lord of history

089 How Deep The Fathers Love

How deep the Fathers love for us,
How vast beyond all measure,
That He should give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure.
How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away,
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.

Behold the man upon a cross,
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished;
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished.

I will not boast in anything,
No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer;
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom.

The dove has wings and she can fly
Lord, give those wings to me

Set my spirit free
To bear me upon the wings of Love
Oh Lord Carry me

091 Speak O Lord

Speak, O Lord, as we come to You
To receive the food of Your Holy Word.
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;
Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,
That the light of Christ might be seen today
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
Speak, O Lord, and fulfil in us
All Your purposes for Your glory.

Teach us, Lord, full obedience,
Holy reverence, true humility;
Test our thoughts and our attitudes
In the radiance of Your purity.
Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love and authority.
Words of pow'r that can never fail
Let their truth prevail over unbelief.

Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;
Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
That will echo down through eternity.
And by grace we'll stand on Your promises,
And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us.
Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built
And the earth is filled with Your glory.

093 The Power Of The Cross

Oh to see the dawn of the darkest day:
Christ on the road to Calvary.
Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten, then
nailed to a cross of wood.

Chorus
This the power of the cross:
Christ became sin for us.
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross.

Oh to see the pain written on Your face
Bearing the awesome weight of sin
Evry bitter thought evry evil deed
Crowning Your blood stained brow.

Chorus
This the power of the cross:
Christ became sin for us.
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross.

Now the daylight flees, now the ground beneath
Quakes as its maker bows His head
Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life
Finished the victry cry.

Chorus
This the power of the cross:
Christ became sin for us.
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross.

Oh to see my name written in the wounds
For through Your suffring I am free
Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

Chorus
This the power of the cross:
Son of God slain for us.
What a Name, what a cost
We stand forgiven at the cross

This the power of the cross:
Christ became sin for us.
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross.

094 My Heart Is Filled

My heart is filled with thankfulness
to Him Who bore my pain;
Who plumbed the depths of my disgrace
and gave me life again;
Who crushed my curse of sinfulness,
and clothed me with His light,
And wrote His law of righteousness
with powr upon my heart.

My heart is filled with thankfulness
to Him Who walks beside;
Who floods my weaknesses with strength
and causes fears to fly;
Whose every promise is enough
for every step I take,
Sustaining me with arms of love
and crowning me with grace.

My heart is filled with thankfulness
to Him Who reigns above;
Whose wisdom is my perfect peace,
Whose every thought is love.
For every day I have on earth
is given by the King.
So I will give my life, my all,
to love and follow Him.

095 Stand Up Stand up For Jesus

Stand up!  stand up for Jesus!
you soldiers of the cross;
Lift high His royal banner;
it must not suffer loss.
From victory onto victory
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished
and Christ is Lord indeed.

Stand up!  stand up for Jesus!
the trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict
in this His glorious day!
You who are men now serve Him
against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger,
and strength to strength oppose.

Stand up!  stand up for Jesus!
stand in His strength alone:
The arm of flesh will fail you;
you dare not trust your own.
Put on the gospel armour;
each piece put on with prayer,
Where duty calls, or danger,
be never wanting there.

Stand up!  stand up for Jesus!
the strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle,
the next the victors song.
To him that overcometh
a crown of life shall be;
He with the King of Glory
shall reign eternally!

096 Loved Before The Dawn Of Time

Loved before the dawn of time,
Chosen by my Maker,
Hidden in my Saviour:
I am His and He is mine,
Cherished for eternity.

When I'm stained with guilt and sin,
He is there to lift me,
Heal me and forgive me;
Gives me strength to stand again,
Stronger than I was before.

So with every breath that I am given
I will sing salvation's song;
And I'll join the chorus of creation
Giving praise to Christ alone.

All the claims of Satan's curse
Lifted through His offering,
Satisfied through suffering;
All the blessings He deserves
Poured on my unworthy soul.

So with every breath that I am given
I will sing salvation's song;
And I'll join the chorus of creation
Giving praise to Christ alone.

Singing glory, honour, wisdom, power
To the Lamb upon the throne.
Hallelujah, I will lift Him high.
Singing glory, honour, wisdom, power
To the Lamb upon the throne.

Hallelujah I will sing with
every breath that I am given
I will sing salvation's song;
And I'll join the chorus of creation
Giving praise to Christ alone.

Stars will fade and mountains fall;
Christ will shine forever,
Love's unfading splendour.
Earth and heaven will bow in awe,
Joining in salvation's song.

O soul are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
Theres light for a look at the Saviour,
And life more abundant and free!

Chorus
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

Thro death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion
For more than conqurors we are!

Chorus
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

His word shall not fail you - He promised;
Believe Him, and all will be well:
Then go to a world that is dying,
His perfect salvation to tell!

Chorus
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

100 Days Of Elijah

These are the days of Elijah,
declaring the word of the Lord;
and these are the days of Your servant, Moses,
righteousness being restored.

And though these are days of great trial,
of famine and darkness and sword,
still we are the voice in the desert crying,
'Prepare ye the way of the Lord.'

Chorus
Behold, He comes riding on the clouds,
shining like the sun at the trumpet call;
lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee,
out of Zion's hill salvation comes.

These are the days of Ezekiel,
the dry bones becoming as flesh;
and these are the days of Your servant, David,
rebuilding a temple of praise.

These are the days of the harvest,
the fields are as white in the world,
and we are the labourers in Your vineyard,
declaring the word of the Lord.

Chorus
Behold, He comes riding on the clouds,
shining like the sun at the trumpet call;
lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee,
out of Zion's hill salvation comes.

Thy Word is a Lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path
Thy Word is a Lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path

When I feel afraid,
Think Ive lost my way,
Still Youre there right beside me.
And nothing will I fear
As long as You are near;
Please be near me to the end

Thy Word is a Lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path
Thy Word is a Lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path

I will not forget,
Your love for me, and yet
My heart forever is wandering.
Jesus be my guide
And hold me to Your side,
And I will love You to the end.

102 What Kind Of Love Is This

What kind of love is this
that gave itself for me?
I am the guilty one,
yet I go free.

What kind of love is this,
a love I've never known?
I didn't even know His name.
What kind of love is this?

What kind of man is this
that died in agony?
He Who had done no wrong
was crucified for me.

What kind of man is this
Who laid aside His throne,
that I may know the love of God?
What kind of man is this?

By grace I have been saved;
it is the gift of God.
He destined me to be His child,
such is His love.

No eye has ever seen,
no ear has ever heard,
nor has the heart of man conceived
what kind of love is this.

103 God Is Love

God is love, let heaven adore Him;
God is love, let earth rejoice;
let creation sing before Him,
and exalt Him with one voice.
God Who laid the earths foundation,
He Who spread the heavens above,
and Who breathes through all creation
God is love, eternal Love.

God is love, and gently enfolding
all the world in one embrace,
with unfailing grasp is holding
every child of every race.
And when human hearts are breaking
under sorrows iron rod,
then they find that self-same aching
deep within the heart of God.

God is love, and though with blindness
sin afflicts our human hearts,
Gods eternal loving kindness
holding, guiding, grace imparts.
Sin and death and hell shall never
o'er us final triumph gain;
God is love, so love for ever
o'er the universe must reign.

104 When Its All Been Said And Done

When it's all been said and done,
there is just one thing that matters;
did I do my best to live for truth,
did I live my life for You?

When it's all been said and done,
all my treasures will mean nothing;
only what I've done for love's reward,
will stand the test of time.

Lord, Your mercy is so great,
that You look beyond our weakness;
and find purest gold in miry clay,
making sinners into saints.

I will always sing Your praise;
here on earth and ever after;
for You've shown me heaven's my true home,
when it's all been said and done,
You're my life when life is gone.

When it's all been said and done,
there is just one thing that matters;
did I do my best to live for truth,
did I live my life for You?

105 The Servant king

From heav'n You came, helpless babe,
entered our world, Your glory veiled;
not to be served but to serve,
and give Your life that we might live.

Chorus
This is our God, the Servant King,
He calls us now to follow Him,
to bring our lives as a daily offering
of worship to the Servant King.

There in the garden of tears,
my heavy load He chose to bear;
His heart with sorrow was torn.
'Yet not My will but Yours,' he said.

Chorus
This is our God, the Servant King,
He calls us now to follow Him,
to bring our lives as a daily offering

Come, see His hands and His feet,
the scars that speak of sacrifice,
hands that flung stars into space,
to cruel nails surrendered.

Chorus
This is our God, the Servant King,
He calls us now to follow Him,
to bring our lives as a daily offering

So let us learn how to serve,
and in our lives enthrone Him;
each other's needs to prefer,
for it is Christ we're serving.

106 The Lords My Shepeherd
Traditional version

The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want;
He makes me down to lie
in pastures green; He leadeth me
the quiet waters by.

My soul He doth restore again;
and me to walk doth make
within the paths of righteousness,
ev'n for His own Name sake.

Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
yet will I fear no ill;
for Thou art with me, and Thy rod
and staff me comfort still.

My table Thou hast furnished
in presence of my foes;
my head Thou dost with oil anoint,
and my cup overflows.

Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me,
and in God's house for evermore
my dwelling place shall be.

The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;

And me to walk does make
within the paths of righteousness,
All for His own Names sake.

Evn though I walk in death's dark vale,
Yet I will fear no ill;
For You are with me, and Your rod
And staff, they comfort me.

My table You have furnished
In the presence of my foes;
And my head You do with oil anoint,

108 In Christ Alone

In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song;
this cornerstone, this solid ground,
firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My Comforter, my all in all,
here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone! - Who took on flesh,
fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
scorned by the ones He came to save:
till on the cross as Jesus died,
the wrath of God was satisfied
for ev'ry sin on Him was laid:
here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain:
then bursting forth in glorious day
up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory
sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
for I am His and He is mine
bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death,
this is the pow'r of Christ in me;
from life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
can ever pluck me from His hand;
till He returns or calls me home,
here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand.

Since You dont mind dirty stables
Heres my heart not fit or able
To receive such majesty
Still, You humbly come to me

Suffring Saviour, Servant King
Since You dont despise the broken
Heres my life laid bare and open
To receive Your mercy

O come, O come
O come, O come, be born again

All who struggle, all who sin
Come and become born again
Come and lay your heavy burdens
At the cross where alls forgiven
At His feet new life begins
Come, O sinner enter in

And come, O come
O come, O come, be born again
And come, please come

As sure as gold is precious, and the honey sweet,
so you love this city, and you love these streets.
Ev'ry child out playing by their own front door,
ev'ry baby lying on the bedroom floor.

Revive us, revive us, revive us with Your fire.

From the preacher preaching when the well is dry,
to the lost soul reaching for a higher high.
From the young man working through his hopes
and fears,
to the widow walking through the vale of tears.

Ev'ry man and woman, ev'ry old and young,
ev'ry father's daughter, ev'ry mother's son;
I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones,
You're going to send revival, bring them all back home.

111 When The Roll Is Called Up Yonder

When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound,
and time shall be no more,
And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;
When the saved of earth shall gather
over on the other shore,
And the roll is called up yonder, Ill be there.

Chorus:
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
Ill be there.

On that bright and cloudless morning
when the dead in Christ shall rise,
And the glory of His resurrection share;
When His chosen ones shall gather
to their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder, Ill be there.

Chorus:
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
Ill be there.

Let us labour for the Master
from the dawn till setting sun,
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care;
Then when all of life is over,
and our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder, Ill be there.

Chorus:
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
Ill be there.

112 And Can It Be

And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Saviours blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me!
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, should die for me!

Tis mystery all!  The Immortal dies:
Who can explore His strange design?
In vain the first-born seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine.
Tis mercy all!  let earth adore,
Let angel minds inquire no more.
Tis mercy all!  let earth adore,
Let angel minds inquire no more.

He left His Fathers throne above -
So free, so infinite His grace -
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adams helpless race.
Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me!
Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me!

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and natures night;
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray -
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.

No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach the eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.
Bold I approach the eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.

God forgave my sin in Jesus' Name,
I've been born again in Jesus' Name;
and in Jesus' Name I come to you
to share His love as He told me to.

Chorus
He said, 'Freely, freely you have received,
freely, freely give;
go in My Name and because you believe
others will know that I live.'

All power is given in Jesus' Name,
in earth and heaven in Jesus' Name;
and in Jesus' Name I come to you
to share His power as He told me to.

Holy words long preserved
for our walk in this world;
they resound with God's own heart,
O, let the ancient words impart;

ancient words will guide us home.

Ancient words, ever true,
changing me, changing you;
we have come with open hearts,
O, let the ancient words impart.

Holy words of our faith
handed down to this age,
came to us through sacrifice;
O, heed the faithful words of Christ;
holy words long preserved
for our walk in this world;
they resound with God's own heart;
O, let the ancient words impart.
Chorus
Ancient words, ever true,
changing me, changing you;

115 Before The Throne Of God Above

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong, a perfect plea,
a great High Priest Whose Name is Love,
Who ever lives and pleads for me.
My name is graven on His hands,
my name is written on His heart;
I know that while in heav'n He stands
no tongue can bid me thence depart,
no tongue can bid me thence depart.

When Satan tempts me to despair,
and tells me of the guilt within,
upward I look and see Him there,
Who made an end to all my sin.
Because the sinless Saviour died,
my sinful soul is counted free;
for God the Just is satisfied
to look on Him and pardon me,
to look on Him and pardon me.

Behold Him there! The risen Lamb,
my perfect, spotless righteousness;
the great unchangeable I Am,
the King of glory and of grace!
One with Himself I cannot die,
my soul is purchased with His blood;
my life is hid with Christ on high,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God.
One with Himself I cannot die,
my soul is purchased with His blood;
my life is hid with Christ on high,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God.

116 Behold The Lamb
The Communion Hymn

Behold the Lamb Who bears our sins away,
Slain for us: and we remember
The promise made that all who come in faith
Find forgiveness at the cross.
So we share in this Bread of life,
And we drink of His sacrifice,
As a sign of our bonds of peace
Around the table of the King.

The body of our Saviour, Jesus Christ,
Torn for you: eat and remember
The wounds that heal, the death that brings us life,
Paid the price to make us one.
So we share in this Bread of life,
And we drink of His sacrifice,
As a sign of our bonds of love
Around the table of the King.

The blood that cleanses every stain of sin,
Shed for you: drink and remember
He drained death's cup that all may enter in
To receive the life of God.
So we share in this Bread of life,
And we drink of His sacrifice,
As a sign of our bonds of grace
Around the table of the King.

And so with thankfulness and faith we rise
To respond: and to remember.
Our call to follow in the steps of Christ
As His body here on earth.
As we share in His suffering,
We proclaim: Christ will come again!
And we'll join in the feast of heaven
Around the table of the King.

118 O For A Thousand Tongues To Sing

O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemers praise,
My great Redeemers praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!
The triumphs of His grace!
The triumphs of His grace!
The triumphs of His grace!

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honours of Thy Name.
The honours of Thy Name.
The honours of Thy Name.
The honours of Thy Name.

Jesus!  The Name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;
That bids our sorrows cease;
Tis music in the sinners ear,
Tis life, and health and peace.
Tis life, and health and peace.
Tis life, and health and peace.
Tis life, and health and peace.

He speaks, and, listening to His voice,
New life the dead receive,
New life the dead receive,
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
The humble poor believe.
The humble poor believe.
The humble poor believe.
The humble poor believe.

He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.
His blood availed for me.
His blood availed for me.
His blood availed for me.

See all your sins on Jesus laid:
The Lamb of God was slain,
The Lamb of God was slain,
His soul was once an offering made.
For every soul of man.
For every soul of man.
For every soul of man.
For every soul of man.

119 God youre Good To Me

God, Youre good to me
You gave me life

You heard me knock
and opened up the door

Opened my eyes
and let me see
I could search,
but I wont find
anyone like You.

120 Morning Has Broken

Morning has broken
like the first morning;
blackbird has spoken
like the first bird.
Praise for the singing,
praise for the morning,
praise for them, springing
fresh from the word.

Sweet the rains new fall
sunlit from heaven,
like the first dewfall
on the first grass.
Praise for the sweetness
of the wet garden,
sprung from completeness
where His feet pass.

Mine is the sunlight;
mine is the morning
born of the one light
Eden saw play.
Praise with elation,
praise every morning,
Gods recreation
of the new day.

121 Abide With Me

Abide with me,
fast falls the eventide;
the darkness deepens;
Lord, with me abide:
when other helpers fail,
and comforts flee,
help of the helpless,
O abide with me.

Swift to its close
ebbs out life's little day;
earth's joys grow dim,
its glories pass away;
change and decay
in all around I see;
O You, Who changes not,
abide with me.

I need Your presence
every passing hour;
what but Your grace
can foil the tempter's pow'r?
Who like Yourself,
my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine,
Lord, abide with me.

I fear no foe,
with You at hand to bless;
ills have no weight,
and tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting?
Where, grave, your victory?
I triumph still,
if You abide with me.

Hold now Your cross
before my closing eyes;
shine through the gloom,
and point me to the skies;
heav'n's morning breaks,
and earth's vain shadows flee;
in life, in death,
O Lord, abide with me.

122 O My Soul

O my soul, arise and bless your maker,
for He is your master and your friend.
Slow to wrath but rich in tender mercy,
worship the Saviour Jesus.

King of grace, His love is overwhelming,
bread of life, He's all I'll ever need.
For His blood has purchased me for ever,
bought at the cross of Jesus.

Chorus
And I will sing for all my days
of heaven's love come down.
Each breath I take will speak His praise
until He calls me home.

When I wake, I know that He is with me,
when I'm weak, I know that He is strong.
Though I fall, His arm is there to lean on,
safe on the rock of Jesus.

Stir in me the songs that you are singing,
fill my gaze with things as yet unseen.
Give me faith to move in works of power,
making me more like Jesus.

Chorus
And I will sing for all my days
of heaven's love come down.
Each breath I take will speak His praise
until He calls me home.

Then one day, I'll see him as He sees me,
face to face, the lover and the loved.
No more words, the longing will be over,
there with my precious Jesus.

Then one day, I'll see Him as He sees me,
face to face, the lover and the loved.
No more words, the longing will be over,

125 The Servant Song

Brother, sister, let me serve you,
let me be as Christ to you;
pray that I may have the grace
to let you be my servant too.

We are pilgrims on a journey
and companions on the road;
we are here to help each other
walk the mile and bear the load.

I will hold the Christ-light for you
in the night-time of your fear;
I will hold my hand out to you,
speak the peace you long to hear.

I will weep when you are weeping;
when you laugh I'll laugh with you;
I will share your joy and sorrow
till we've seen this journey through.

When we sing to God in heaven
we shall find such harmony,
born of all we've known together
of Christ's love and agony.

Brother, sister, let me serve you,
let me be as Christ to you;
pray that I may have the grace
to let you be my servant too.

Be Thou my vision,
Lord of my heart,
naught be all else to me,
save that Thou art -
Thou my best thought,
by day or by night,
waking or sleeping,
Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my wisdom,
be Thou my true word;
I ever with Thee,
Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father,
I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling,
and I with Thee one.

Be Thou my battle-shield,
my sword for the fight,
Be Thou my dignity,
Thou my delight;
Thou my soul's shelter,
Thou my high tower:
raise Thou me heavenward,
O Power of  my power.

Riches I heed not,
nor man's empty praise,
Thou mine inheritance,
now and always:
Thou and Thou only,
first in my heart,
High King of heaven,
my treasure Thou art.

High King of heaven,
after victory won,
may I reach heaven's joys,
O bright heaven's Son!
Heart of my own heart,
whatever befall,
still be my vision,
O Ruler of all.

128 My Eyes Have Seen The Glory

My eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He has loosed the fateful lightning
of His terrible swift sword:
His truth is marching on.

Chorus
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
before His judgement seat:
O be swift, my soul, to answer Him;
be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

Chorus
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea,
with a glory in His bosom
which transfigures you and me:
As He died to make us holy,
let us live to make all free,
While God is marching on.

Chorus
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

He is coming like the glory
of the morning on the wave;
He is wisdom to the mighty;
He is succour to the brave:
So the world shall be His foot-stool,
and the soul of time His slave
Our God is marching on.

Chorus
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
Glory, glory Hallelujah!

129 O Thou Who Camest From Above

O Thou Who camest from above
The pure celestial fire to impart,
Kindle a flame of sacred love
On the mean altar of my heart!

There let it for Thy glory burn
With inextinguishable blaze;
And trembling to its source return,
In humble prayer and fervent praise.

Jesus, confirm my heart's desire
To work, and speak, and think for Thee;
Still let me guard the holy fire,
And still stir up Thy gift in me;

Ready for all Thy perfect will,
My acts of faith and love repeat,
Till death Thy endless mercies seal,
And make the sacrifice complete.

136 The Old Rugged Cross

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suff'ring and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

Chorus
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown.

Oh that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary

Chorus
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In the old rugged cross stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see;
For t'was on that old cross Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me.

Chorus
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,
its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory for ever I'll share.

Chorus
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown.

138 Rock Of Ages

Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin a double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

Not the labours of my hands
Can fulfil Thy laws demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
All for sin could not atone,
Thou must save, and Thou alone.

Nothing in my hand I bring;
Simply to Thy Cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, Look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyelids close in death,
When I soar through tracts unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgement throne,
Rock of Ages, Cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.

139 When I Survey The Wondrous Cross

When I survey the wondrous cross
on which the Prince of Glory died,
my richest gain I count but loss,
and pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
save in the death of Christ, my God:
all the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See from His head, His hands, His feet,
sorrow and love flow mingling down:
did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
that were an offering far too small;
love so amazing, so divine,
demands my soul, my life, my all.

140 Create In Me A Clean Heart

Create in me a clean heart O God,
and renew a right spirit within me.
Create in me a clean heart O God,
and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from Your presence O Lord,
and take not Your Holy Spirit from me.
Restore unto me the joy of my salvation
and renew a right spirit within me.

141 God Of The Poor

Beauty for brokenness,
hope for despair,
Lord, in the suffering,
this is our prayer.
Bread for the children,
justice, joy, peace,
sunrise to sunset
Your kingdom increase.

Shelter for fragile lives,
cures for their ills,
work for the craftsmen,
trade for their skills.
Land for the dispossessed,
rights for the weak,
voices to plead the cause
of those who cannot speak.

God of the poor, friend of the weak,
give us compassion, we pray,
melt our cold hearts, let tears fall like rain.
Come, change our love from a spark to a flame.

Refuge from cruel wars,
havens from fear,
cities for sanctuary,
freedoms to share.
Peace to the killing fields,
scorched earth to green,
Christ for the bitterness,
His cross for the pain.

God of the poor, friend of the weak,
give us compassion, we pray,
melt our cold hearts, let tears fall like rain.
Come, change our love from a spark to a flame.

Rest for the ravaged earth,
oceans and streams,
plundered and poisoned,
our future, our dreams.
Lord, end our madness,
carelessness, greed;
make us content with
the things that we need.

God of the poor, friend of the weak,
give us compassion, we pray,
melt our cold hearts, let tears fall like rain.
Come, change our love from a spark to a flame.

Lighten our darkness,
breathe on this flame,
until Your justice
burns brightly again;
until the nations
learn of Your ways,
seek Your salvation
and bring You their praise.

God of the poor, friend of the weak,
give us compassion, we pray,
melt our cold hearts, let tears fall like rain.
Come, change our love from a spark to a flame.

142 Just Let Me Say

Just let me say how much I love You,
let me speak of Your mercy and grace,
just let me live in the shadow of Your beauty,
let me see You face to face.
And the earth will shake
as Your word goes forth
and the heavens can tremble and fall.
Just let me say how much I love You,
O my Saviour, my Lord and friend.

Just let me hear Your finest whispers
as You gently call my name.
And let me see Your power and Your glory,
let me feel Your Spirit's flame.
Let me find You in the desert
'til this sand is holy ground
and I am found completely surrendered
to You, my Lord and friend.

So let me say how much I love You,
with all my heart I long for You.
For I am caught in this passion of knowing
this endless love I've found in You.
And the depth of grace,
the forgiveness found
to be called a child of God
just makes me say how much I love You,
O my Saviour, my Lord and friend.

143 Great Is The Darkness

Great is the darkness
that covers the earth,
oppression, injustice and pain.
Nations are slipping in hopeless despair,
though many have come in Your name.
Watching while sanity dies,
touched by the madness and lies.

Chorus
Come, Lord Jesus,
come, Lord Jesus,
pour out Your Spirit, we pray.
Come, Lord Jesus,
come, Lord Jesus,
pour out Your Spirit on us today.

May now Your church rise with power and love,
this glorious gospel proclaim.
In every nation salvation will come
to those who believe in Your Name.
Help us bring light to this world
that we might speed Your return.

Chorus
Come, Lord Jesus,
come, Lord Jesus,
pour out Your Spirit, we pray.
Come, Lord Jesus,

Great celebrations on that final day
when out of the heavens You come.
Darkness will vanish, all sorrow will end,
and rulers will bow at Your throne.
Our great commission complete,
then face to face we shall meet.

Chorus

thus setting us free.

Casting down their golden crowns

Perfect in power,

149 Guide Me O Thou Great Jehovah

Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,
pilgrim through this barren land;
I am weak, but Thou art mighty,
hold me with Thy pow'rful hand:
Bread of heaven, Bread of heaven,
feed me now and evermore,
feed me now and evermore.

Open now the crystal fountain
whence the healing stream doth flow;
let the fiery, cloudy pillar
lead me all my journey through:
strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer,
be Thou still my strength and shield,
be Thou still my strength and shield.

When I tread the verge of Jordan
bid my anxious fears subside;
death of death, and hell's destruction,
land me safe on Canaan's side:
songs of praises, songs of praises,
I will ever give to Thee,
I will ever give to Thee.

Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You,
hope of a life spent with You.

Glorious in heaven above.
Humbly You came to the earth You created,
all for love's sake became poor.

by His hands the dry land was formed.

as His people did in time of old.

Lo! He comes with clouds descending
once for favoured sinners slain;
Thousand thousand saints attending,
swell the triumph of His train!
Hallelujah!  Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
God appears on earth to reign.

Evry eye shall now behold Him
robed in awesome majesty;
those who set at nought and sold Him,
pierced and nailed Him to the tree,
Deeply wailing, deeply wailing,
deeply wailing,
shall the true Messiah see.

The dear Tokens of His Passion
still His dazzling body bears;
cause of endless exultation
to His ransomed worshippers:
with what rapture, with what rapture,
with what rapture,
gaze we on those glorious scars!

Yea, amen!  Let all adore Thee,
high on Thy eternal throne;
Saviour, take the powr and the glory
claim the kingdom for Thine own;
O Come quickly!  O Come quickly!
O Come quickly!
Ever lasting God come down.

Filled with the Spirit's power, with one accord

O Holy Spirit, in the church today
no less Your power of fellowship display.

Now with the mind of Christ set us on fire,
that unity may be our great desire:
give joy and peace; give faith to hear Your call,
and readiness in each to work for all.

Widen our love, good Spirit, to embrace
in Your strong care all those of every race:
like wind and fire with life among us move
till we are known as Christ's, and Christians prove.

164 Gethsemane Hymn

To see the King of heaven fall
In anguish to His knees,
The Light and Hope of all the world
Now overwhelmed with grief.
What nameless horrors must He see,
To cry out in the garden:
Oh, take this cup away from me
Yet not my will but Yours,
Yet not my will but Yours.

To know each friend will fall away,
And heavens voice be still,
For hell to have its vengeful day
Upon Golgothas hill.
No words describe the Saviours plight
To be by God forsaken
Till wrath and love are satisfied
And every sin is paid
And every sin is paid

What took Him to this wretched place,
What kept Him on this road?
His love for Adams cursd race,
For every broken soul.
No sin too slight to overlook,
No crime too great to carry,
All mingled in this poisoned cup
And yet He drank it all,
The Saviour drank it all,
The Saviour drank it all

For none shall compare to Your matchless worth:
sing unto the Ancient of Days.

Chrous
Every tongue in heaven and earth
shall declare Your glory,
every knee shall bow at Your throne
in worship;
You will be exalted, O God,
and Your kingdom shall not pass away,
O Ancient of Days.

167 Because He Lives

In the early morning light
Mary made her way
One more time to say goodbye
Where her Master lay
Tears of sorrow turn to joy
Hear the angels say
You wont find the Saviour here
Christ is risen today

Chorus
Because He lives
Because He lives
We have a hope that will remain
Because He gives eternal life
To those who call upon His Name

As we journey through this world
Singing Gods great song
Age to age the story told
Of the risen one
Holy fire breathe on us
Resurrection power
Signs and wonders follow us
Every waking hour

Chorus
Because He lives
Because He lives
We have a hope that will remain
Because He gives eternal life
To those who call upon His Name

Jesus lives
Jesus lives
Jesus lives
Jesus lives

Chorus
Because He lives
Because He lives
We have a hope that will remain
Because He gives eternal life
To those who call upon His Name

Because He lives
Because He lives
We have a hope that will remain
Because He gives eternal life
To those who call upon His Name

Because He lives
Because He lives
Because He lives

All heav'n declares
the glory of the risen Lord.
Who can compare
with the beauty of the Lord?
For ever He will be
the Lamb upon the throne.
I gladly bow the knee

169 Amazing Love

My Lord, what love is this,
that pays so dearly,
that I, the guilty one,
may go free!

Amazing love, O what sacrifice,
the Son of God, giv'n for me.
My debt He pays, and my death He dies,
that I might live,
that I might live.

And so they watched Him die,
despised, rejected;
but O, the blood He shed
flowed for me!

Amazing love, O what sacrifice,
the Son of God, giv'n for me.
My debt He pays, and my death He dies,
that I might live,
that I might live.

And now this love of Christ
shall flow like rivers;
come, wash your guilt away,
live again!

Amazing love, O what sacrifice,
the Son of God, giv'n for me.
My debt He pays, and my death He dies,
that I might live,
that I might live.

This love, this hope,
This peace of God, this righteousness,
This faith, this joy,
This life complete in me.

Now healed and whole,
And risen in His righteousness,
I live in Him,
He lives in me,
And filled with this hope in God,
Reflecting His glory.

Now is the time to worship You,
Now is the time to offer You
All of my thoughts, my dreams and plans;
I lay it down.
Now is the time to live for You,
Now is the time Im found in You.
Now is the time Your kingdom comes.

173 By Faith

By faith we see the hand of God
In the light of creation's grand design
In the lives of those who prove His faithfulness
Who walk by faith and not by sight

By faith our fathers roamed the earth
With the power of His promise in their hearts
Of a holy city built by God's own hand
A place where peace and justice reign

We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward
Till the race is finished and the work is done
We'll walk by faith and not by sight

By faith the prophets saw a day
When the longed-for Messiah would appear
With the power to break the chains of sin and death
And rise triumphant from the grave

By faith the church was called to go
In the power of the Spirit to the lost
To deliver captives and to preach good news
In every corner of the earth

We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward
Till the race is finished and the work is done
We'll walk by faith and not by sight

By faith this mountain shall be moved
And the power of the gospel shall prevail
For we know in Christ all things are possible
For all who call upon His Name

We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward
Till the race is finished and the work is done
We'll walk by faith and not by sight

174 Just A Closer Walk With Thee

Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea,
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

I am weak, but Thou art strong;
Jesus, keep me from all wrong;
Ill be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.

Through this world of toil and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

When my feeble life is oer,
Time for me will be no more;
Guide me gently, safely oer
To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore.

Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea,
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

175 Creation Sings

Creation sings the Fathers song;
He calls the sun to wake the dawn
And run the course of day,
Till evening falls in crimson rays.
His fingerprints in flakes of snow,
His breath upon this spinning globe;
He charts the eagles flight,
Commands the newborn babys cry.

Chorus
Hallelujah! Let all creation stand and sing,
Hallelujah! Fill the earth with songs of worship,
Tell the wonders of creations King.

Creation gazed upon His face;
The ageless One in times embrace
Unveiled the Fathers plan
Of reconciling God and man.
A second Adam walked the earth,
Whose blameless life would break the curse,
Whose death would set us free
To live with Him eternally.

Chorus
Hallelujah! Let all creation stand and sing,
Hallelujah! Fill the earth with songs of worship,
Tell the wonders of creations King.

Creation longs for His return,
When Christ shall reign upon the earth;
The bitter wars that rage
Are birth pains of a coming age.
When He renews the land and sky,
All heaven will sing and earth reply
With one resplendent theme:
The glory of our God and King!

Chorus
Hallelujah! Let all creation stand and sing,
Hallelujah! Fill the earth with songs of worship,
Tell the wonders of creations King.

177 Crown Him With Many Crowns

Crown Him with many crowns,
he Lamb upon His throne;
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns
all music but its own.
Awake my soul and sing
of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy matchless King
through all eternity.

Crown Him the Lord of life,
Who triumphed o'er the grave,
and rose victorious in the strife,
for those He came to save;
His glories now we sing,
Who died and rose on high,
Who died eternal life to bring,
and lives, that death may die.

Crown Him the Lord of peace,
Whose pow'r a sceptre sways
From pole to pole that wars may cease,
and all be prayer and praise:
His reign shall know no end,
and round His piercd feet
fair flowers of paradise extend
their fragrance ever sweet.

Crown Him the Lord of love;
be-hold His hands and side,
those wounds yet visible above,
in beauty glorified:
No angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends his burning eye
at mysteries so bright.

Crown Him the Lord of Years,
the Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres,
ineffably sublime.
All hail Redeemer, hail!
For You have died for me;
Your praise and glo-ry shall not fail
through all eternity.

179 To God Be The Glory

To God be the glory, great things He has done!
So loved He the world that He gave us his Son,
Who yielded His life and atonement for sin
and opened the life-gate that all may go in.

Chorus
Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord!
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord!
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father,
through Jesus the Son;
and give Him the glory,
great things He has done!

O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
to every believer the promise of God!
and every offender who truly believes,
that moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

Chorus
Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord!
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord!
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father,
through Jesus the Son;
and give Him the glory,
great things He has done!

Great things He has taught us,
great things He has done,
and great our rejoicing
through Jesus the Son;
but purer, and higher,
and greater will be
our wonder, our rapture,
when Jesus we see

Chorus
Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord!
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord!
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father,
through Jesus the Son;
and give Him the glory,
great things He has done!

180 All Things Bright And Beautiful

Chorus
All things bright and beautiful,
all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful
the Lord God made them all.

Each little flower that opens,
each little bird that sings
he made their glowing colours,
he made their tiny wings.

Chorus
All things bright and beautiful,
all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful
the Lord God made them all.

The cold wind in the winter,
the pleasant summer sun,
the ripe fruits in the garden
he made them every one.

Chorus
All things bright and beautiful,
all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful
the Lord God made them all.

The purple-headed mountain,
the river running by,
the sunset and the morning
that brightens up the sky,

Chorus
All things bright and beautiful,
all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful
the Lord God made them all.

He gave us eyes to see them,
and lips that we might tell
how great is God Almighty
who has made all things well.

Chorus
All things bright and beautiful,
all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful
the Lord God made them all.

181 Battle Hymn

Theres a sound on the wind
like a victory song
Listen now, let it rest on your soul.
It's a song that I learned
from a heavenly King,
It's the song of a battle royal.

There's a loud shout of victory
that leaps from our hearts
As we wait for our conquering King.
There's a triumph resounding
from dark ages past
To the victory song we now sing.

Come on heaven's children,
The city is in sight.
There will be no sadness
On the other side.

There'll be crowns for the conquerors
and white robes to wear,
There will be no more sorrow or pain.
And the battles of earth
shall be lost in the sight
Of the glorious Lamb that was slain.

Now the King of the ages
approaches the earth,
He will burst through the gates of the sky,
And all men shall bow down
to His beautiful name,
We shall rise with a shout, we shall fly!

Come on, heaven's children,
The city is in sight.
There will be no sadness
On the other side.

Now the King of the ages
approaches the earth,
He will burst through the gates of the sky,
And all men shall bow down
to His beautiful name
We shall rise with a shout, we shall fly!

184 At The Name Of Jesus

At the Name of Jesus,
every knee shall bow,
Every tongue confess Him
King of glory now;
Tis the Fathers pleasure
we should call Him Lord,
Who from the beginning
was the mighty Word.

Mighty and mysterious
in the highest height,
God from everlasting,
very light of light:
In the Fathers bosom
with the spirit blest,
Love, in love eternal,
rest, in perfect rest.

At His voice creation
sprang at once to sight,
All the angel faces,
all the hosts of light,
Thrones and dominations,
stars upon their way,
All the heavenly orders,
in their great array.

Humbled for a season,
to receive a name
From the lips of sinners
unto whom He came,
Faithfully He bore it,
spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious
when from death He passed.

Bore it up triumphant
with its human light,
Through all ranks of creatures,
to the central height,
To the throne of Godhead,
to the Fathers breast;
Filled it with the glory
of that perfect rest.

Name Him, brothers, name Him,
with love strong as death
But with awe and wonder,
and with bated breath!
He is God the Saviour,
He is Christ the Lord,
Ever to be worshipped,
trusted and adored.

In your hearts enthrone Him;
there let Him subdue
All that is not holy,
all that is not true;
Crown Him as your Captain
in temptations hour;
Let His will enfold you
in its light and power.

Brothers, this Lord Jesus
shall return again,
With His Fathers glory,
with His angel train;
For all wreaths of empire
meet upon His brow,
And our hearts confess Him
King of glory now

188 I Know Whom I Have Believed

I know not why God's wondrous grace
to me He has made known
Nor why unworthy Christ in love
redeemed me for His own

But I know whom I have believd
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day

I know not how this saving faith
to me He did impart
Nor how believing in His word
wrought peace within my heart

But I know whom I have believd
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day

I know not how the Spirit moves
convincing men of sin
Revealing Jesus through the Word
creating faith in Him

But I know whom I have believd
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day

I know not what of good or ill
may be reserved for me
Of weary ways or golden days
before His face I see

But I know whom I have believd
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day

I know not when my Lord may come
at night or noonday fair
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him
or meet Him in the air

But I know whom I have believd
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day

190 Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven

Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;
to His feet thy tribute bring;
ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
who like me His praise should sing?
Praise Him, praise Him, hallelujah,
praise the everlasting King!

Praise Him for His grace and favour
to our fathers in distress;
praise Him still the same for ever,
slow to chide, and swift to bless:
Praise Him, praise Him, hallelujah,
glorious in His faithfulness.!

Father-like He tends and spares us;
well our feeble frame he knows;
in His hands He gently bears us,
rescues us from all our foes;
Praise Him, praise Him, hallelujah,
widely as His mercy flows!

Frail as summer's flower we flourish,
blows the wind and it is gone;
but while mortals rise and perish,
God endures unchanging on.
Praise Him, praise Him, hallelujah,
praise the High Eternal One!

Angels, help us to adore Him,
ye behold Him face to face;
sun and moon, bow down before Him,
dwellers all in time and space:
Praise Him, praise Him, hallelujah,
praise with us the God of grace!
