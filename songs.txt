017 how great thou art

o lord my god, when i in awe-some wonder
consider all the works thy hands have made,
i see the stars, i hear the mighty thunder,
thy power throughout the universe displayed!

chorus:
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art!  how great thou art!
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art!  how great thou art!

when through the woods and forest glades i wander
and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,
when i look down from lofty mountain grandeur
and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze,

chorus:
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art!  how great thou art!
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art!  how great thou art!

and when i think that god, his son not sparing,
sent him to die, i scarce can take it in.
that on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
he bled and died to take away my sin!

chorus:
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art!  how great thou art!
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art!  how great thou art!

when christ shall come with shout of acclamation
and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
then i shall bow in humble adoration
and there proclaim, my god, how great thou art!

chorus:
then sings my soul, my saviour god, to thee,
how great thou art!  how great thou art!

030 the compassion hymn

there is an everlasting kindness
you lavished on us
when the radiance of heaven
came to rescue the lost;
you called the sheep without a shepherd
to leave their distress
for your streams of forgiveness
and the shade of your rest.

and with compassion for the hurting,
you reached out your hand
as the lame ran to meet you
and the dead breathed again;
you saw behind the eyes of sorrow
and shared in our tears,
heard the sigh of the weary,
let the children draw near.

chorus
what boundless love,
what fathomless grace
you have shown us, o god of compassion!
each day we live
an offering of praise
as we show to the world your compassion.

we stood beneath the cross of calvary
and gazed on your face
at the thorns of oppression
and the wounds of disgrace,
for surely you have borne our suffering
and carried our grief
as you pardoned the scoffer
and showed grace to the thief.

chorus
what boundless love,
what fathomless grace
you have shown us, o god of compassion!
each day we live
an offering of praise
as we show to the world your compassion.

how beautiful the feet that carry
this gospel of peace
to the fields of injustice
and the valleys of need
to be a voice of hope and healing,
to answer the cries
of the hungry and helpless
with the mercy of christ.

chorus
what boundless love,
what fathomless grace
you have shown us, o god of compassion!
each day we live
an offering of praise
as we show to the world your compassion.

as pants the hart for cooling streams,
when heated in the chase,
so longs my soul, o god, for you,
and your refreshing grace.

for you, my god, the living god,
my thirsty soul does pine;
o when shall i behold your face,
your majesty divine

god of my strength, how long shall i,
like one forgotten, mourn?
forlorn, forsaken, and exposed
to my oppressors scorn.

why restless, why cast down, my soul?
hope still, and i shall sing
the praise of him who is my god,
my healths eternal spring.

034 amazing grace

amazing grace!  how sweet the sound.
that saved a wretch like me!
i once was lost, but now am found.
was blind, but now i see.

twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
and grace my fears relieved:
how precious did that grace appear
the hour i first believed!

through many dangers, toils and snares
i have already come;
tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
and grace will lead me home.

the lord has promised good to me.
his word my hope secures;
he will my shield and portion be
as long as life endures.

yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
and mortal life shall cease,
i shall possess within the veil
a life of joy and peace.

the earth shall soon dissolve like snow;
the sun forbear to shine;
but god who called me here below,
will be forever mine.

when ive been there ten thousand years,
bright shining as the sun,
ive no less days to sing gods praise
than when i first begun.

035 crimson stream

there is a crimson stream
that washes white as snow
a love that longs to know me as your own
this hope, the light of life
this grace that wont let go
this fire that burns can change a heart of stone

nothing can stop this love from reaching me
nothing can keep your blood from cleansing me
nothing can change your mercies, new each day
oh i believe in you
my jesus i will give my heart to you

no shame can keep me bound
no sin can own the keys
the price was paid in full to set me free
no more these filthy rags
im clothed in purity
my saviours righteousness is mine to keep

nothing can stop this love from reaching me
nothing can keep your blood from cleansing me
nothing can change your mercies, new each day
oh i believe in you
my jesus i will give my heart to you

036 there is a hope

there is a hope that burns within my heart,
that gives me strength for evry passing day:
a glimpse of glory now revealed in meagre part,
yet drives all doubt away:
i stand in christ with sins forgivn;
and christ in me, the hope of heavn!
my highest calling and my deepest joy,
to make his will my home

there is a hope that lifts my weary head,
a consolation strong against despair,
that when the world has plunged me in its deepest pit,
i find the saviour there!
through present sufferings, future's fear,
he whispers 'courage' in my ear.
for i am safe in everlasting arms,
and they will lead me home.

there is a hope that stands the test of time,
that lifts my eyes beyond the beckoning grave,
to see the matchless beauty of a day divine
when i behold his face!
when sufferings cease and sorrows die,
and every longing satisfied.
then joy unspeakable will flood my soul,
for i am truly home.

you knew the path before you
in the garden you shed tears
you endured the lash and took my shame
my cross you chose to bear
your love shown in your actions
my debt now washed away
you give life, to all who believe
who trust you and obey

when satan tries to snare me
and he tries to pull me down
its enough to know youre with me
that youll lift me to safe ground
i find comfort in your love
i find shelter in your wings
your strength is all i need
for when im weak, i am strong

as i run the race before me
with my eyes only on you
may you strengthen me and guide me
may i long to live for you
i will run and not grow weary
i will walk and not be faint
you uphold me and sustain me
youre my hope, my lord
i will run and not grow weary
i will walk and not be faint
you uphold me and sustain me
youre my hope, my lord, my life.

046 the god of abraham praise

the god of abraham praise,
who reigns enthroned above,
ancient of everlasting days,
and god of love.
jehovah!  great i am!
by earth and heaven confessed;
i bow and bless the sacred name
for ever blessed.

the god of abraham praise,
at whose supreme command
from earth i rise, and seek the joys
at his right hand.
i all on earth forsake -
its wisdom, fame, and power -
and him my only portion make,
my shield and tower.

though natures strength decay;
and earth and hell withstand;
to canaan's bounds i urge my way
at his command.
the watery deep i pass,
with jesus in my view,
and through the howling wilderness
my way pursue.

the god of abraham praise,
whose all sufficient grace
shall guide me all my happy days
in all my ways
he calls a worm his friend,
he calls himself my god;
and he shall save me to the end
through jesus blood

he by himself hath sworn,
i on his oath depend:
i shall, on eagles wings upborne,
to heaven ascend;
i shall behold his face,
i shall his power adore,
and sing the wonders of his grace
for evermore.

the whole triumphant host
gives thanks to god on high;
hail! father, son and holy ghost,
they ever cry.
hail! abrahams god and mine;
i join the heavenly lay:
all might and majesty are thine
and endless praise.

above all wealth and treasures of the earth
theres no way to measure what youre worth

crucified
laid behind the stone
you lived to die
rejected and alone
like a rose
trampled on the ground
you took the fall
and thought of me

above all

he has hushed the laws loud thunder.
he has quenched mount sinais flame:
he has washed us with his blood.
he has brought us nigh to god.
he has washed us with his blood.
he has brought us nigh to god.

let us love the lord who bought us.
pitied us when enemies,
called us by his grace, and taught us,
gave us ears and gave us eyes:
he has washed us with his blood,
he presents our souls to god.
he has washed us with his blood,
he presents our souls to god.

threaten hard to bear us down!
for the lord, our strong salvation,
holds in view the conquerors crown:
he who washed us with his blood
soon will bring us home to god.
he who washed us with his blood
soon will bring us home to god.

when through grace in christ our trust is,
justice smiles, and asks no more.

has secured our way to god.
he who washed us with his blood
has secured our way to god.

let us praise, and join the chorus
of the saints enthroned on high;
here they trusted him before us,
now their praises fill the sky:
you have washed us with your blood;
you are worthy, lamb of god.
you have washed us with your blood;

a frame so beautifully formed,
brought to life by god's own breath.
crafted from the planets dust,
god's own image carved in flesh.
but not one righteousness remains,
perfection lost, and beauty stained.
far from the safety of god's side,
innocence traded for a lie.

all my shame,
all i've failed to be nailed upon a cross
and left at calvary

a world of fabulous design,
yet scarred with misery and pain.
but underneath this brokenness,
our maker's signature remains.
and only your redeeming love
can pay the debt we can't afford.
salvation worked by your own hand,
your broken workmanship restored.

087 christ is risen

in the tomb so cold they laid him,
death its victim claimd.
powrs of hell, they could not hold him;
back to life he came!

chorus
christ is risen!
death has been conquered
christ is risen!
he shall reign for ever.

hell had spent its fury on him,
left him crucified.
yet, by blood, he boldly conquered,
sin and death defied.

chorus
christ is risen!
death has been conquered
christ is risen!
he shall reign for ever.

now the fear of death is broken,
love has won the crown.
prisners of the darkness listen,
walls are tumbling down.

chorus
christ is risen!
death has been conquered
christ is risen!
he shall reign for ever.

raised from death to heaven ascending,
loves exulted king.
let his song of joy, unending,
through the nations ring.

chorus
christ is risen!
death has been conquered
christ is risen!
he shall reign for ever.

christ is risen!
death has been conquered
christ is risen!

088 joy has dawned

joy has dawned upon the world,
promised from creation:
gods salvation now unfurled,
hope for evry nation.
not with fanfares from above,
not  with scenes of glory,
but a humble gift of love:
jesus born of mary.

sounds of wonder fill the sky
with the songs of angels,
as the mighty prince of life
shelters in a stable.
hands that set each star in place,
shaped the earth in darkness,
cling now to a mothers breast,
vulnerable and helpless.

shepherds bow before the lamb,
gazing at the glory;
gifts of men from distant lands
prophesy the story.
gold, a king is born today,
incense, god is with us,
myrrh, his death will make a way,
by his blood hell win us.

son of adam, son of heaven,
given as a ransom
reconciling god and man,
christ our mighty champion!
what a saviour, what a friend
what a glorious mystery:
once a babe in bethlehem,
now the lord of history

089 how deep the fathers love

how deep the fathers love for us,
how vast beyond all measure,
that he should give his only son
to make a wretch his treasure.
how great the pain of searing loss
the father turns his face away,
as wounds which mar the chosen one
bring many sons to glory.

behold the man upon a cross,
my sin upon his shoulders;
ashamed, i hear my mocking voice
call out among the scoffers.
it was my sin that held him there
until it was accomplished;
his dying breath has brought me life
i know that it is finished.

i will not boast in anything,
no gifts, no power, no wisdom;
but i will boast in jesus christ,
his death and resurrection.
why should i gain from his reward?
i cannot give an answer;
but this i know with all my heart
his wounds have paid my ransom.

oh to see the dawn of the darkest day:
christ on the road to calvary.
tried by sinful men, torn and beaten, then
nailed to a cross of wood.

chorus
this the power of the cross:
christ became sin for us.
took the blame, bore the wrath
we stand forgiven at the cross.

oh to see the pain written on your face
bearing the awesome weight of sin
evry bitter thought evry evil deed
crowning your blood stained brow.

chorus
this the power of the cross:
christ became sin for us.
took the blame, bore the wrath
we stand forgiven at the cross.

now the daylight flees, now the ground beneath
quakes as its maker bows his head
curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life
finished the victry cry.

chorus
this the power of the cross:
christ became sin for us.
took the blame, bore the wrath
we stand forgiven at the cross.

oh to see my name written in the wounds
for through your suffring i am free
death is crushed to death, life is mine to live
won through your selfless love

chorus
this the power of the cross:
son of god slain for us.
what a name, what a cost
we stand forgiven at the cross

this the power of the cross:
christ became sin for us.
took the blame, bore the wrath
we stand forgiven at the cross.

stand up!  stand up for jesus!
you soldiers of the cross;
lift high his royal banner;
it must not suffer loss.
from victory onto victory
his army shall he lead,
till every foe is vanquished
and christ is lord indeed.

stand up!  stand up for jesus!
the trumpet call obey;
forth to the mighty conflict
in this his glorious day!
you who are men now serve him
against unnumbered foes;
let courage rise with danger,
and strength to strength oppose.

stand up!  stand up for jesus!
stand in his strength alone:
the arm of flesh will fail you;
you dare not trust your own.
put on the gospel armour;
each piece put on with prayer,
where duty calls, or danger,
be never wanting there.

stand up!  stand up for jesus!
the strife will not be long;
this day the noise of battle,
the next the victors song.
to him that overcometh
a crown of life shall be;
he with the king of glory
shall reign eternally!

loved before the dawn of time,
chosen by my maker,
hidden in my saviour:
i am his and he is mine,
cherished for eternity.

when i'm stained with guilt and sin,
he is there to lift me,
heal me and forgive me;
gives me strength to stand again,
stronger than i was before.

so with every breath that i am given
i will sing salvation's song;
and i'll join the chorus of creation
giving praise to christ alone.

all the claims of satan's curse
lifted through his offering,
satisfied through suffering;
all the blessings he deserves
poured on my unworthy soul.

so with every breath that i am given
i will sing salvation's song;
and i'll join the chorus of creation
giving praise to christ alone.

singing glory, honour, wisdom, power
to the lamb upon the throne.
hallelujah, i will lift him high.
singing glory, honour, wisdom, power

god is love, let heaven adore him;
god is love, let earth rejoice;
let creation sing before him,
and exalt him with one voice.
god who laid the earths foundation,
he who spread the heavens above,
and who breathes through all creation
god is love, eternal love.

god is love, and gently enfolding
all the world in one embrace,
with unfailing grasp is holding
every child of every race.
and when human hearts are breaking
under sorrows iron rod,
then they find that self-same aching
deep within the heart of god.

god is love, and though with blindness
sin afflicts our human hearts,
gods eternal loving kindness
holding, guiding, grace imparts.
sin and death and hell shall never
o'er us final triumph gain;
god is love, so love for ever
o'er the universe must reign.

0108 in christ alone

in christ alone my hope is found,
he is my light, my strength, my song;
this cornerstone, this solid ground,
firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
what heights of love, what depths of peace,
when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
my comforter, my all in all,
here in the love of christ i stand.

in christ alone! - who took on flesh,
fullness of god in helpless babe!
this gift of love and righteousness,
scorned by the ones he came to save:
till on the cross as jesus died,
the wrath of god was satisfied
for ev'ry sin on him was laid:
here in the death of christ i live.

there in the ground his body lay,
light of the world by darkness slain:
then bursting forth in glorious day
up from the grave he rose again!
and as he stands in victory
sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
for i am his and he is mine
bought with the precious blood of christ.

no guilt in life, no fear in death,
this is the pow'r of christ in me;
from life's first cry to final breath,
jesus commands my destiny.
no pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
can ever pluck me from his hand;
till he returns or calls me home,
here in the pow'r of christ i'll stand.

i rose, went forth, and followed thee.

0115 before the throne of god above

before the throne of god above
i have a strong, a perfect plea,
a great high priest whose name is love,
who ever lives and pleads for me.
my name is graven on his hands,
my name is written on his heart;
i know that while in heav'n he stands
no tongue can bid me thence depart,
no tongue can bid me thence depart.

when satan tempts me to despair,
and tells me of the guilt within,
upward i look and see him there,
who made an end to all my sin.
because the sinless saviour died,
my sinful soul is counted free;
for god the just is satisfied
to look on him and pardon me,
to look on him and pardon me.

behold him there! the risen lamb,
my perfect, spotless righteousness;
the great unchangeable i am,
the king of glory and of grace!
one with himself i cannot die,
my soul is purchased with his blood;
my life is hid with christ on high,
with christ, my saviour and my god,
with christ, my saviour and my god.
one with himself i cannot die,
my soul is purchased with his blood;
my life is hid with christ on high,
with christ, my saviour and my god,
with christ, my saviour and my god.

0116 behold the lamb
the communion hymn

behold the lamb who bears our sins away,
slain for us: and we remember
the promise made that all who come in faith
find forgiveness at the cross.
so we share in this bread of life,
and we drink of his sacrifice,
as a sign of our bonds of peace
around the table of the king.

the body of our saviour, jesus christ,
torn for you: eat and remember
the wounds that heal, the death that brings us life,
paid the price to make us one.
so we share in this bread of life,
and we drink of his sacrifice,
as a sign of our bonds of love
around the table of the king.

the blood that cleanses every stain of sin,
shed for you: drink and remember
he drained death's cup that all may enter in
to receive the life of god.
so we share in this bread of life,
and we drink of his sacrifice,
as a sign of our bonds of grace
around the table of the king.

and so with thankfulness and faith we rise
to respond: and to remember.
our call to follow in the steps of christ
as his body here on earth.
as we share in his suffering,
we proclaim: christ will come again!
and we'll join in the feast of heaven
around the table of the king.

morning has broken
like the first morning;
blackbird has spoken
like the first bird.
praise for the singing,
praise for the morning,
praise for them, springing
fresh from the word.

sweet the rain's new fall
sunlit from heaven,
like the first dewfall
on the first grass.
praise for the sweetness
of the wet garden,
sprung from completeness
where his feet pass.

mine is the sunlight;
mine is the morning
born of the one light
eden saw play.
praise with elation,
praise every morning,
god's recreation
of the new day.

cool the grey clouds roll
peaking the mountains,
gull in her free flight
swooping the skies:
praise for the mystery
misting the morning
behind the shadow
waiting to shine.

i am the sunrise
warming the heavens,
spilling my warm glow
over the earth:
praise for the brightness
of this new morning
filling my spirit
with your great love.

mine is a turning,
mine is a new life;
mine is a journey
closer to you:
praise for the sweet glimpse
caught in a moment,
joy breathing deeply
dancing in flight.

lord, with me abide:

and comforts flee,

ebbs out life's little day;
earth's joys grow dim,

every passing hour;
what but your grace

who like yourself,

through cloud and sunshine,

i fear no foe,
with you at hand to bless;
ills have no weight,
and tears no bitterness.
where is death's sting?
where, grave, your victory?
i triumph still,
if you abide with me.

hold now your cross
before my closing eyes;
shine through the gloom,
and point me to the skies;

and earth's vain shadows flee;

and companions on the road;

i will weep when you are weeping;
when you laugh i'll laugh with you;
i will share your joy and sorrow
till we've seen this journey through.

when we sing to god in heaven
we shall find such harmony,
born of all we've known together
of christ's love and agony.

0138 rock of ages

rock of ages, cleft for me,
let me hide myself in thee;
let the water and the blood
from thy riven side which flowed,
be of sin a double cure,
cleanse me from its guilt and power.

not the labours of my hands
can fulfil thy laws demands;
could my zeal no respite know,
could my tears for ever flow,
all for sin could not atone,
thou must save, and thou alone.

nothing in my hand i bring;
simply to thy cross i cling;
naked, come to thee for dress;
helpless, look to thee for grace;
foul, i to the fountain fly;
wash me, saviour, or i die.

while i draw this fleeting breath,
when mine eyelids close in death,
when i soar through tracts unknown,
see thee on thy judgement throne,
rock of ages, cleft for me,
let me hide myself in thee.

0139 when i survey the wondrous cross

when i survey the wondrous cross
on which the prince of glory died,
my richest gain i count but loss,
and pour contempt on all my pride.

forbid it, lord, that i should boast,
save in the death of christ, my god:
all the vain things that charm me most,
i sacrifice them to his blood.

see from his head, his hands, his feet,
sorrow and love flow mingling down:
did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
or thorns compose so rich a crown?

were the whole realm of nature mine,
that were an offering far too small;
love so amazing, so divine,
demands my soul, my life, my all.

and take not your holy spirit from me.
restore unto me the joy of my salvation
and renew a right spirit within me.

0141 god of the poor

beauty for brokenness,
hope for despair,
lord, in the suffering,
this is our prayer.
bread for the children,
justice, joy, peace,
sunrise to sunset
your kingdom increase.

shelter for fragile lives,
cures for their ills,
work for the craftsmen,
trade for their skills.
land for the dispossessed,
rights for the weak,
voices to plead the cause
of those who cannot speak.

god of the poor, friend of the weak,
give us compassion, we pray,
melt our cold hearts, let tears fall like rain.
come, change our love from a spark to a flame.

refuge from cruel wars,
havens from fear,
cities for sanctuary,
freedoms to share.
peace to the killing fields,
scorched earth to green,
christ for the bitterness,
his cross for the pain.

god of the poor, friend of the weak,
give us compassion, we pray,
melt our cold hearts, let tears fall like rain.
come, change our love from a spark to a flame.

rest for the ravaged earth,
oceans and streams,
plundered and poisoned,
our future, our dreams.
lord, end our madness,
carelessness, greed;
make us content with
the things that we need.

god of the poor, friend of the weak,
give us compassion, we pray,
melt our cold hearts, let tears fall like rain.
come, change our love from a spark to a flame.

lighten our darkness,
breathe on this flame,
until your justice
burns brightly again;
until the nations
learn of your ways,
seek your salvation
and bring you their praise.

god of the poor, friend of the weak,
give us compassion, we pray,
melt our cold hearts, let tears fall like rain.
come, change our love from a spark to a flame.

0142 just let me say

just let me say how much i love you,
let me speak of your mercy and grace,
just let me live in the shadow of your beauty,
let me see you face to face.
and the earth will shake
as your word goes forth
and the heavens can tremble and fall.
just let me say how much i love you,
o my saviour, my lord and friend.

just let me hear your finest whispers
as you gently call my name.
and let me see your power and your glory,
let me feel your spirit's flame.
let me find you in the desert
'til this sand is holy ground
and i am found completely surrendered
to you, my lord and friend.

so let me say how much i love you,
with all my heart i long for you.
for i am caught in this passion of knowing
this endless love i've found in you.
and the depth of grace,
the forgiveness found
to be called a child of god
just makes me say how much i love you,
o my saviour, my lord and friend.

pilgrim through this barren land;
i am weak, but thou art mighty,
hold me with thy pow'rful hand:
bread of heaven, bread of heaven,
feed me now and evermore,
feed me now and evermore.

open now the crystal fountain
whence the healing stream doth flow;
let the fiery, cloudy pillar
lead me all my journey through:
strong deliverer, strong deliverer,
be thou still my strength and shield,
be thou still my strength and shield.

when i tread the verge of jordan
bid my anxious fears subside;
death of death, and hell's destruction,
land me safe on canaan's side:
songs of praises, songs of praises,
i will ever give to thee,
i will ever give to thee.

robed in awesome majesty;

with what rapture, with what rapture,

0164 gethsemane hymn

to see the king of heaven fall
in anguish to his knees,
the light and hope of all the world
now overwhelmed with grief.
what nameless horrors must he see,
to cry out in the garden:
oh, take this cup away from me
yet not my will but yours,
yet not my will but yours.

to know each friend will fall away,
and heavens voice be still,
for hell to have its vengeful day
upon golgothas hill.
no words describe the saviours plight
to be by god forsaken
till wrath and love are satisfied
and every sin is paid
and every sin is paid

what took him to this wretched place,
what kept him on this road?
his love for adams cursd race,
for every broken soul.
no sin too slight to overlook,
no crime too great to carry,
all mingled in this poisoned cup
and yet he drank it all,
the saviour drank it all,
the saviour drank it all

0169 amazing love

my lord, what love is this,
that pays so dearly,
that i, the guilty one,
may go free!

amazing love, o what sacrifice,
the son of god, giv'n for me.
my debt he pays, and my death he dies,
that i might live,
that i might live.

and so they watched him die,
despised, rejected;
but o, the blood he shed
flowed for me!

amazing love, o what sacrifice,
the son of god, giv'n for me.
my debt he pays, and my death he dies,
that i might live,
that i might live.

and now this love of christ
shall flow like rivers;
come, wash your guilt away,
live again!

amazing love, o what sacrifice,
the son of god, giv'n for me.

0173 by faith

by faith we see the hand of god
in the light of creation's grand design
in the lives of those who prove his faithfulness
who walk by faith and not by sight

by faith our fathers roamed the earth
with the power of his promise in their hearts
of a holy city built by god's own hand
a place where peace and justice reign

we will stand as children of the promise
we will fix our eyes on him our soul's reward
till the race is finished and the work is done
we'll walk by faith and not by sight

by faith the prophets saw a day
when the longed-for messiah would appear
with the power to break the chains of sin and death
and rise triumphant from the grave

by faith the church was called to go
in the power of the spirit to the lost
to deliver captives and to preach good news
in every corner of the earth

we will stand as children of the promise
we will fix our eyes on him our soul's reward
till the race is finished and the work is done
we'll walk by faith and not by sight

by faith this mountain shall be moved
and the power of the gospel shall prevail
for we know in christ all things are possible
for all who call upon his name

we will stand as children of the promise
we will fix our eyes on him our soul's reward
till the race is finished and the work is done
we'll walk by faith and not by sight

just a closer walk with thee,
grant it, jesus, is my plea,
daily walking close to thee,
let it be, dear lord, let it be.

i am weak, but thou art strong;
jesus, keep me from all wrong;
ill be satisfied as long
as i walk, let me walk close to thee.

through this world of toil and snares,
if i falter, lord, who cares?
who with me my burden shares?
none but thee, dear lord, none but thee.

when my feeble life is oer,
time for me will be no more;
guide me gently, safely oer
to thy kingdom shore, to thy shore.

just a closer walk with thee,

daily walking close to thee,

0175 creation sings

creation sings the fathers song;
he calls the sun to wake the dawn
and run the course of day,
till evening falls in crimson rays.
his fingerprints in flakes of snow,
his breath upon this spinning globe;
he charts the eagles flight,
commands the newborn babys cry.

chorus
hallelujah! let all creation stand and sing,
hallelujah! fill the earth with songs of worship,
tell the wonders of creations king.

creation gazed upon his face;
the ageless one in times embrace
unveiled the fathers plan
of reconciling god and man.
a second adam walked the earth,
whose blameless life would break the curse,
whose death would set us free
to live with him eternally.

chorus
hallelujah! let all creation stand and sing,
hallelujah! fill the earth with songs of worship,
tell the wonders of creations king.

creation longs for his return,
when christ shall reign upon the earth;
the bitter wars that rage
are birth pains of a coming age.
when he renews the land and sky,
all heaven will sing and earth reply
with one resplendent theme:
the glory of our god and king!

chorus
hallelujah! let all creation stand and sing,
hallelujah! fill the earth with songs of worship,
tell the wonders of creations king.

crown him with many crowns,
he lamb upon his throne;
hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns
all music but its own.
awake my soul and sing
of him who died for thee,
and hail him as thy matchless king
through all eternity.

crown him the lord of life,
who triumphed o'er the grave,
and rose victorious in the strife,
for those he came to save;
his glories now we sing,
who died and rose on high,
who died eternal life to bring,
and lives, that death may die.

crown him the lord of peace,
whose pow'r a sceptre sways
from pole to pole that wars may cease,
and all be prayer and praise:
his reign shall know no end,
and round his piercd feet
fair flowers of paradise extend
their fragrance ever sweet.

crown him the lord of love;
be-hold his hands and side,
those wounds yet visible above,
in beauty glorified:
no angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends his burning eye
at mysteries so bright.

crown him the lord of years,
the potentate of time,
creator of the rolling spheres,
ineffably sublime.
all hail redeemer, hail!
for you have died for me;
your praise and glo-ry shall not fail
through all eternity.

0181 battle hymn

theres a sound on the wind
like a victory song
listen now, let it rest on your soul.
it's a song that i learned
from a heavenly king,
it's the song of a battle royal.

there's a loud shout of victory
that leaps from our hearts
as we wait for our conquering king.
there's a triumph resounding
from dark ages past
to the victory song we now sing.

come on heaven's children,
the city is in sight.
there will be no sadness
on the other side.

there'll be crowns for the conquerors
and white robes to wear,
there will be no more sorrow or pain.
and the battles of earth
shall be lost in the sight
of the glorious lamb that was slain.

now the king of the ages
approaches the earth,
he will burst through the gates of the sky,
and all men shall bow down
to his beautiful name,
we shall rise with a shout, we shall fly!

come on, heaven's children,
the city is in sight.
there will be no sadness
on the other side.

now the king of the ages
approaches the earth,
he will burst through the gates of the sky,
and all men shall bow down
to his beautiful name
we shall rise with a shout, we shall fly!

0184 at the name of jesus

at the name of jesus,
every knee shall bow,
every tongue confess him
king of glory now;
tis the fathers pleasure
we should call him lord,
who from the beginning
was the mighty word.

mighty and mysterious
in the highest height,
god from everlasting,
very light of light:
in the fathers bosom
with the spirit blest,
love, in love eternal,
rest, in perfect rest.

at his voice creation
sprang at once to sight,
all the angel faces,
all the hosts of light,
thrones and dominations,
stars upon their way,
all the heavenly orders,
in their great array.

humbled for a season,
to receive a name
from the lips of sinners
unto whom he came,
faithfully he bore it,
spotless to the last,
brought it back victorious
when from death he passed.

bore it up triumphant
with its human light,
through all ranks of creatures,
to the central height,
to the throne of godhead,
to the fathers breast;
filled it with the glory
of that perfect rest.

name him, brothers, name him,
with love strong as death
but with awe and wonder,
and with bated breath!
he is god the saviour,
he is christ the lord,
ever to be worshipped,
trusted and adored.

in your hearts enthrone him;
there let him subdue
all that is not holy,
all that is not true;
crown him as your captain
in temptations hour;
let his will enfold you
in its light and power.

brothers, this lord jesus
shall return again,
with his fathers glory,
with his angel train;
for all wreaths of empire
meet upon his brow,
and our hearts confess him
king of glory now

praise, my soul, the king of heaven;
to his feet thy tribute bring;
ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
who like me his praise should sing?
praise him, praise him, hallelujah,
praise the everlasting king!

praise him for his grace and favour
to our fathers in distress;
praise him still the same for ever,
slow to chide, and swift to bless:
praise him, praise him, hallelujah,
glorious in his faithfulness.!

father-like he tends and spares us;
well our feeble frame he knows;
in his hands he gently bears us,
rescues us from all our foes;
praise him, praise him, hallelujah,
widely as his mercy flows!

frail as summer's flower we flourish,
blows the wind and it is gone;
but while mortals rise and perish,
god endures unchanging on.
praise him, praise him, hallelujah,
praise the high eternal one!

angels, help us to adore him,
ye behold him face to face;
sun and moon, bow down before him,
dwellers all in time and space:
praise him, praise him, hallelujah,
praise with us the god of grace!
